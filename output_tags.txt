And if I received XXXX letter why would I not receive the other letter. Maybe the post office lost it. Why would that be fault of mine? The approval letter from Bank of America dated XXXX XXXX which I received at my home mentions that I do not need to take any further action to accept this offer. The letter also states that my home loan account balance will automatically be forgiven unless I call XXXX before XXXX XXXX to decline the offer.

2015 and I have yet to receive any information to verify that this erroneous account being reported in a negative way to the credit bureaus under my credit profile. I was under the impression that a company is given 30 days to verify this information or it should be removed from my credit profile.	1
2015 and I still have not been reimbursed. I have made numerous visits to both banks and am still getting the run-around.	1
2015 and I was told that my HAMP Loan Modification is under review. The lady I spoke with	1

This payment was confirmed by my bank and the reinstatement process was initiated. I later noticed on XXXX/XXXX/15 my personal card ( XXXX ) was being declined. It appears both of my AMEX cards were cancelled by account services. AMEX states I would need to pay a {$25.00} reinstatement fee and that is the only way to get credit or use my membership rewards points. Every conversation with AMEX gives a different story and we continue to disagree. I am looking for my rewards that I earned and should be able to use within XXXX days of cancellation.

I have called so many times and keep being transferred from department to department and no one can explain how the property was sold without them knowing or notifying me. On XXXX XXXX I called again and was told from now on I need to contact Fannie Mae instead. I did and was told they will start an investigation but representative basically told me to just ask the listing agent they have assigned to my property to beg her for cash for keys. I do n't want to do that. I have been trying for years to reach an agreement with the bank so I can bring my loan up to date and keep being denied even though I know for a fact I qualify for a loan modification. Please help me. I do n't know what else to do. They just refuse to help me and XXXX knows I did not default on my loan because of negligence on my part. I am a father and my children will be homeless in this cold winter if they refuse to help.	1

This is a violation of CFPB regulations for loss mitigation servicing and it is the same violations that lead to the national settlement. They have delayed reviewing my file for approximately 5 months and then claim that I did not submit the required documents the day that my approval letter from the XXXX expired. Today I had a manager review the file and all of the documents that had ben requested were there. I then had to go over all of the income statement by statement to show them that the RMA was correct.

2015. I was in XXXX XXXX at that time. I have receipts to prove this. They added late fees even though I was never notified. If they had had an e-mail address I would have been alerted to the fraud. Now I have to wait 7-10 days before I receive a fraud report to send back to them. Macy 's says it will take 90-120 days for it be investigated	1

2015. So XXXX XXXX I go to my bank and I get a cashier 's check in the amount that XXXX specified in the email. At the closing the Closer tells me that I need a cashier 's check for a greater amount than the amount we agreed upon in the email. This is impossible because it is after XXXX and the bank is closed. After numerous phone calls to XXXX and his office he decides to absorb the difference. At the closing we are told that we should receive our escrow refund {$1600.00} in 60 days.	1
2015. That has not happened. When I spoke with the County	1

Select Portfolio says that they will not honor the agreement because it was not signed.

2015. The letter was mailed to Ocwen Loan Servicing	1
2015. The reason for decline was negative NPV and the appeal letter stated that Nationstar did not provide full values used when calculating NPV so we could not fully understand the reason for decline. The appeal was denied on XXXX XXXX	1
2015. The second response is that they 're sorry but they ca n't access my account and I 'll be directed to an customer service representative and the phone would hang up on me. I also noticed it is XXXX different female voice operators. Numerous times the phone hung up on me and I only spoke to XXXX representative XXXX separate times and when they told me the issue and said they were going to resolve my account issue they had me on hold for over and hour and when I would call back the phone hangs up before it can even ring or the holding music plays.

On XXXX XXXX they failed to close because there was an error in the amount of the loan. On XXXX XXXX they failed to close because they had the wrong zipcode on their paperwork. On XXXX XXXX they failed to close because they could n't get their work done. On XXXX XXXX I borrowed from my retirement plan and settled on the new home -- because my family was left homeless by the "" game-playing '' and failure to follow through of Discover Home Loans. I want everyone to know of the nightmare they put me through. I have extensive documentation to prove what I am saying. The settlement company said they have never seen a customer treated so badly. This was abuse and something should be done to stop them from making promises they ca n't keep. The "" {$1000.00} guarantee '' that they will close on time is worthless because they only pay out if you stay with the abuse and close with them. It is a racket and should be stopped.	1
2015. They have also inappropriately shared sensitive information to these XXXX parties.	1
2015. They refuse the FULL payment each and every time. I have appeared on numerous occasions which began on XXXX XXXX	1
2015. This caused the payoff to be incorrect. Instead of notifying anyone	1

2015. This has caused extreme emotional distress on the entire family.. I have made repeated attempts to deal with Nation Star in an attempt to speak to someone in authority in order to work out a settlement agreement and I was never allowed to speak with anyone. I was at XXXX time on the phone with them for more than 2.5 hours trying to resolve something and was just passed from person to person all of whom told me the same thing. "" that there was nothing they can do. '' There is still no resolution. The home is currently listed and there is a short sale offer pending.	1
2015. This has caused financial stress on me with the issue of paying bills and having money to get to work and eat daily. For the past weeks I had to stress over how I am going to have enough gas to get to work. Today I called and was told that the system is yet again down and my account has went from {$500.00} to {$0.00} XXXX times today. On the occurrences that I seen money available I went to the ATM and get invalid responses and is told to contact my financial institution. I call them and they have NO answers of the time frame	1
2015. This is how I found out about this loan and subsequently contact XXXXARGON. To-date	1
2015. This left me with an available credit of {$5.00}	1

2015. This was not considered to be notice that I wanted to end my lease and leave. There was a form that I did not know about that is given to indicate notice to vacate an apartment. I found out about this form	1
2015. Thus far they have not acknowledged nor responded to it. Under the real estate settlement procedures act	1

Honor health sent me to collections the same day because I refused to make formal payment arrangements. The collection agency will not take payments said I had to talk to the Hosp. the Hosp will not take payments because they turned it over to collections. I only had 2 payments left and no one can decide where I should send them. The collection agency and Hosp want the full amount. I was told that XXXX XXXX REQUIRES a patient to set up payment arrangements. Can they demand full payment? I figured I 'd have this paid off in less than 6 months actually it would be 4 months so a payment arrangement contract did n't seem necessary. But now no one wants the MONEY. The per diem charge was new in XXXX usually we had a co-pay it came as a great surprise that now we have a per diem. They have me delinquent because the charge was for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX even though I did n't get a bill until XXXX XXXX. Is it true that even if you make your payments you can still be sent to collections? it seems a bit odd that a creditor would rather take 50 % than the entire balance. If they are willing to take 50 % I could do that.. Do n't know what to do now	1

I 'm demanding this be correct. This has to be against the law.I have also been advised because of this XXXX up on Ditech 's part my account was reported 30 days past due to the credit bureau because of the issues going on and the way my account tis coded. I make my payments by the close of business each month via online and have never been 30 days past due. My payment of {$550.00} is sitting in a unapplied account as we speak but Ditech drafted my account on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. This needs to be corrected ASAP there is no more room for error with this company. The VP of the horrible company needs to be advised of the service that the company that he/she represent is presenting. My loan has been transferred 3 times and I have NEVER had any issues until now. I need my account coded correct because I do not receive assistance	1
I 'm forced to pay money into an escrow account that has FAR more money than necessary to pay the required expenses.

I 'm very disappointed and this is the only attempt they have made. I also do not like how they are threatening us in this letter and I wo n't tolerate it. We will pay this but their terrible collection practices need to be looked into	1

I believe it was inappropriate for them to identify themselves using an abbreviation when I asked them for the specific name of their company ; they used the same tactic when my mom spoke to them. In and of itself	1
I believe no shipping was charged.	1
I believe that any type of negative reporting on my credit from Home depo/Citi bank is not accurate and was done wrongly	1
I believe that they need to send me a notice 15 days before the transfer. I received the notice	1
I believe their application provides a range of APR 's until the applicant submits the application and then the applicant discovers what rate Capital One has granted the applicant. It is quite possible that Capital One has a standard that I did not reach with regard to credit worthiness. Unfortunately	1
I believe these $ XXXX in fees is unethical and abusive. I repeatedly asked the bank to freeze my account so that if anything else comes in	1
I believe they have violated several provisions of the FDCPA. Moreover	1
I believe what the motorcycle shop did was akin to theft and I am sure Capital One does not want to acknowledge any association with criminal activities. A couple of key facts : I never stepped foot into the motorcycle store	1
I believe.	1

I ca n't see how I will make the balloon payment unless I win the lottery. The loan was part of an XXXX piggyback deal predicated on the market going up. When the market tanked	1

I call and it 's actually 10-14 business days. They have recordings and notes in the system that confirm that I was lied to and they STILL are not going to do anything about it today. My husband has been unable to make any purchses with his credit card as it 's showing a late payment. It 's effecting out credit and nobody is willing to accept any responsibility for the lies.	1
I call collections and spoke with rep ID XXXX who informed me I had a escrow shortage of {$1600.00} and my account was being prepared for foreclosure. She transferred me to customer services XXXX ID XXXX ... she said an escrow analysis was done on XXXX XXXX and mailed XXXX XXXX	1

I called OCWEN 's customer service multiple times and sent them several more letters requesting to close my escrow account. The account is still not closed. Among excuses there were statements that the letters were not received or that it was too close to the date when the property tax is to be remitted to the state. I receive a written response only XXXX time after I sent OCWEN the letter by certified mail. In their response they refused closing my escrow account saying again that it was too close to the date when the property tax is to be remitted to the state and suggested that I send them yet another letter. The latter suggestion sounds senseless. Nothing prevents OCWEN from closing my escrow account after the property tax is paid. They already have several letters from me that clearly show my request to close my escrow account.	1
I called One Main and I asked them just to confirm	1
I called PRA again this week they are still insisting that they do n't have my information	1

I called their customer service group and told them what I was doing	1
I called them and they sent me boxes to return the equipment. They received the equipment and never removed this from my credit report. They have used several agencies to collect money from me when I sent back all of their equipment. This is fraud and no one would listen to me.	1
I called them back and gave them my phone number ( STILL do n't know how they got her number ) and told them not to contact my minor child again and to remove her number. Since then	1
I called them back stating our arrangement. I further instructed they could call me at the number I gave them no more than once per day. If that was not acceptable	2
I called them to make payment arrangements because I was tired of the calls. The young lady quoted a high monthly figure over {$100.00}. I stated that I could not afford that. During this conversation	2

She should have told me that she was unable to provide a Pay in Full Amount since interest is calculated the following day automatically by a computer system. I had enough. I asked whether this fiasco was impacting my credit. She said not at the time but strongly advised that the now {$7.00} be paid immediately. I proceeded to pay. Well	1
I called to confirm and was told that due to my lack of response	1
I called to inquire about my refund check. The XXXX rep said I had to wait 3 months before they would look into it further or reissue the check. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX rep had trouble finding my information because she said the loan was "" closed '' and "" archived '' so she had no record of it in her system.

I called yesterday XX/XX/XXXX they said check went out on XX/XX/XXXX. Here its the XX/XX/XXXX and I still have not recieved my money. Is this legal for them to do. I did nothing wrong and I feel like they are the criminals they have my money and wont give it to me. I have been told by others that it has happen to them and their bank did not treat them like this. What can I do? What legal rights do I have?	1
I called. I did not get the name of young lady I was speaking with but she was very condescending.	1
I came home crying my eyes out. I had a look in my eye before from the staff members that I would never ever get a job and I could look for the rest of my life and no one would hire me. And I have processed that feeling although it comes and it goes. Maybe these banks should add a Human Behavior course that Americans will lie	1
I came to an agreement with XXXX/Bank of America where we agreed to a full settlement payoff of {$100.00} ( settlement letter dtd XX/XX/XXXX ). The issue is that this incident is showing up on my and my spouse 's CREDIT REPORT as a "" SERIOUS DELINQUENCY ''. I ask that this incident which was paid off in agreement in the amount of {$100.00} be removed from my credit report. I contacted Bank of America directly to ask that they remove this incident from my credit report but they said that I would need to file a complaint through the XXXX Credit Bureaus for them to consider and they referred me to the XXXX credit reporting agencies which they then referred me to your website as they could n't address my request to have this incident removed from my credit report.	1
I came to the conclusion this agency does not want to resolve any issues and just want to scare me into paying them again. I already paid for a debt that was n't mine in the first place and I 'm not inclined to pay more and put up with such harrasment.	1
I came with my mother to get a check deposit. We had to wait a long line. Finally we got to the counter and met a guy name XXXX. Because my mother had an issue about the check and already talked to another man named XXXX so XXXX told my mother to come back which is today. XXXX then called XXXX to come and talk to us	1
I can afford to pay the mortgage	1
I can definitely afford the payments and need to keep my XXXX children in their home.	1
I can never get ahead.	1
I can not access my account in any way due to the lack of ATM/PINverification. The wonderfully brilliant powers at Citibank decided that an ATM card and PINcombo is the only way to verify identity ... even though they accepted an initial deposit from this very same unverified identity. It is XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
I can not be self sufficient and be on my own with this amount of money coming out of my check every pay. I would like them to adjust the amount they take or add those loans to my consolidated loans in which I qualify for the income based repayment plan which is more affordable to me. I do n't want to end of losing my job because I ca n't afford transportation there. My living expenses are a hardship just to take care of bare minimum items.	1
I can not find out who / what company it is being compromised by ... so I can opt to pay cash at that company in the future. This is a waste of my time and energy - having to change everything all the time. I deserve to know what is going on with my card if I call and ask.	1
I can not get a rep. on the phone to assist. They add the next months payment to the statement on the XXXX of the month and then charge a late fee of XXXX if it is not paid on the XXXX of the following month. This is not a reputable bank. I wish I was given a choice. I am sure many other struggling families are frustrated. Please help.	1
I can not go to another financial company for assistance to refinance my property due to First Guaranty Mortgage Corporation holding on to my FHA number and not giving me information that I needed on my mortgage property tax ( XXXX ) in other to re-assign my re-finance loan to another financial mortgage institution.	1
I can not refinance to a better rate because they are not updating my records and there credit report on me. In short	1
I can not rent with any other landlords. Them adding this to my credit illegally has affected my ability to get a place to live. The landlord was given proper notices and opportunities to fix the unit I lived in but failed to do so. I legally vacated the unit and there should have been no further charges or debts. If this company would have notified me of the debt	1
I can not set up a graduated payment plan or make interest only payments.	1
I can not verify that any of these charges are accurate	1
I can now afford the monthly mortgage payment. But	1
I can request new replacement cards. Not only ca n't I access my money but I was told that I will be charged {$34.00} per card. I was promised that my cards will be delivered to me no later than Monday	1
I can reverse the charge but you will be responsible for future late fees. '' They imposed the late fees through their own action and not because I was late. I have since had to re-structure my payment plan to pay the entire amount once per month so they can not continue to manipulate the pay date to unfairly charge bogus late fees. It is not a courtesy to give me back money that they had no right to take in the first place.	1
I can start it XXXX days prior to the auction date. My loan is not a XXXX or XXXX XXXX but it 's owned by a private investor	1
I can use the card as a gift card ( as a non-T-Mobile wireless customer ) with various fees attached to the card.	1
I cancel this XXXX transaction just now and ask for a refund. I am writing so that consumers know about this experience and that Western Union improves the services of their agents in other countries. Meanwhile	1
I canceled that service by XXXX phone calls to XXXX XXXX agents and a personal visit to a XXXX store in XXXX	1
I cancelled my Internet and TV service from XXXX and verified that I had a XXXX balance with the account representative. Indeed	1
I cancelled my bi-weekly payment plan with the third party vendor and decided to sign-up for automatic withdrawals or electronic funds transfer from my new bank account. I was unaware of the tedious process it takes to sign-up for the eft service that resulted in a late payment on my account. Because I do not bank with PNC - they make you download a form to sign-up for eft service that you have to print out and mail-in. It then takes 30 days to process this form. Because my payment was late	1
I cancelled my card and paid in full. Still no call from a supervisor.	1
I cannot correctly determine their containment.	1
I cant attach emails ). It got so BAD that I got XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to assist with the paperwork because I sent everything in. They agreed and I filled out there packet and they refused to look at it and closed the case for help. Consequently	1
I cant reset it because I am still waiting for a card so I have no idea how much money is in my account now and there is n't anything they can do. This is very unprofessional if you do n't have the money or technology required to do a update do n't do it because XXXX customers are dependent on you for a means of living. This is sad	1
I changed the provider of my bundled services. I contacted XXXX and advised them I was cancelling my service due to the above issues. I was informed I would pay an early cancellation penalty since I did not keep the service for the two year period. I informed the Customer Service representative I did not commit to a two year agreement and this was the first I was hearing from them.

I called Med-1 Solutions and was told that there was nothing they could do to remove it unless it was reported in error. I was also told that as long as the account still had a balance that it was eligible to go to collections at any time. This is where the problem comes in. I was NEVER told this. NEVER. Obviously I care about my credit. If I did not then I would not be making monthly payments to them. Had I been informed on XXXX/XXXX/2015 when I made my first payment that there was still a potential for this debt to be reported to my credit report then I would have figured out another way to get it paid faster.

I dispute the validity of this debt.	1
I disputed again in Equifax and they replied me back with same answer that it belongs to me! So	1
I disputed the debt and requested copies of their records substantiating this alleged debt. They refused to provide anything. I received correspondence via US Postal Service from Walled Lake Credit Bureau ( WLCB ) LLC	1
I disputed the fees because in reviewing my account online. I could see that it was another person who sold the items. Ebay agreed with me at that time and cleared my account.

I do n't think anything is secure with them.	1
I do not accept preventing me from viewing my account. The deposited checks were from my XXXX checking account which has direct deposit of funds received for death benefits for my husband who died XXXX/XXXX/15. The direct deposit in the XXXX account ( XXXX ) had not been received on the date the insurance company promised. I explained this to Huntington reps numerous times.	1
I do not believe I owe anything because I was not aware my 0 % was up and believe they want online statements to gain money from unaware customers like myself. I believe I am owed back the difference I 've been forced to pay in interest. They charged me the interest for the entire year because my 0 % was up ... I had money to pay in full but was going to pay monthly because I thought I had 0 % for 18 months. Almost {$200.00} ... Unreal! From what I have found online they have done this to many many customers!! Appalling and criminal!	1
I do not believe I should have been charged a late fee. Moreover	1
I do not believe he was entitled to. He tried to obfuscate the fact that he was with a collection agency and not part of the company that provided the service whose bill was being collected. His tactics were targeted towards getting me riled up	1

I do not need very many more people to start a class action lawsuit	1
I do not normally receive checks from them.	1
I do not owe this debt and the calls keep coming. They are now stating that they have a case against me and they want my home or work address so they can serve me papers. I want this to stop.	1
I do not own any checks for this account. The actions taken by Bank of America are discriminatory and predatory because they adversely impact on lower income customers who maintain low balances. The fees charged have a greater impact on customer like myself who can lest afford to have to pay these fees. According to my XXXX records all my payments scheduled for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX will be going by personal check they are no longer doing electronic payments even.	1
I do not qualify for the XXXX XXXX anymore and they will not accept the cash offer they originally said they would accept so they are forcing me to foreclosure. They will force me to be homeless rather than accept a buyer. I did not sell the loan to the private investor Ocwen did.

I feel that their practices are unfair and deceptive to consumers and that they should correct this immediately. I do n't know who in the right mind would say that 24.99 % is a low rate. I believe that they should honor the 2.09 % as the APR since they deceitfully lead me to believe that they were quoting the APR as ALL lenders disclose credit card rates using APR.	1
I elected to secure a mortgage through them. In a nutshell	1
I email but still cant seem to get someone to look into this issue and resolve it. I believe they are trying to wrongfully foreclose on my house. I have spoke to XXXX attorneys and they have advised me to check out respa and to try and work out with Nationstar first	1
I emailed XXXX XXXX	1
I end up not being able to repay the full amount owed by me to Citi each month because the Current Balance shown is not accurate. This works in the bank 's favor by hiding balance information from me and potentially allowing them to charge me fees if I underpay.	1

XXXX said only XXXX more pay stubs & 2 months bank statements were needed which I. XXXX XXXX in the Settlement Conference department of XXXX XXXX XXXX 's office said file was complete and looked good for modification. Court attorney told bank attorney to inform me in writing if mod was granted or denied by XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
I explained to XXXX XXXX that this property was foreclosed upon on XXXX. I informed XXXX XXXX that they were erroneously reporting this as an active and delinquent upon my credit report. I requested that it be removed immediately. XXXX XXXX asked me to show proof of the foreclosure date along with the reporting on the credit report. XXXX XXXX requested that I email this information to him which was done on XXXX. He responded positively and said he would personally take care of the matter and have it rectified within 48 hours.	1
I explained to her and several other employees of XXXX that it is their job to prove this debt and that I was requesting it by phone and she said she would "" see what I can do '' which is not acceptable so I requested to speak to her supervisor who was conveniently unavailable and then she hung up on me. I called back and spoke to a different person in the same office who said that the first lady that I just spoke with was now UNAVALIABLE. I again expressed my desire to dispute this debt and that I was requesting this formally NOW on the recorded phone line. I was finally told that XXXX would have to call me the following day which is today ( XXXX/XXXX/2016 ) and I received no call from Anyone at XXXX.	1
I explained to her my XXXX conversations with the previous agents and she then tells me I owe {$480.00}. I 'm trying to ask about how it went from {$280.00} to {$420.00} and then to {$480.00} all in three business days and she says I must have my numbers wrong and kept bringing up the fact they do n't do settlements. I kept stating	1
I explained to him I was not handing my personal information over unknown if it was a scam or not because how he answered the phone and with never receiving a bill or phone call prior to this date. He stated that he would send me an official email but I had to call him back within an hour so he could follow up with the clients for further legal action if needed and I ended the call. He never relayed to me that it was an attempt to collect a debt and any jnformation would be used for that purpose.

Not only has the date changed but the price of the debt is significantly higher than should be. I have no other option than to submit a complaint. If nothing can be done from a complaint then next course of action would be contacting an attorney to investigate the matter in more detail for legal actions.	1

On XXXX XXXX I received a phone call fromChase Financial Services again about XXXX yet this call was threatening and belligerent in nature from a manager within that organization. Under his terms if I did n't accept taking the XXXX back I would be subject to having my XXXX wages garnished by their dealership. I can consider this harassment and unethical practice towards consumer who no longer wants and can not afford dealing with Chase Financial Services Inc. especially after such a belligerent conversation from their management staff. As a XXXX XXXX Worth consumer and a XXXX Veteran I will certainly never do business again with Chase Financial Services. The rates for their used vehicles are tremendously over blown for any market financing	1
I have recieved a notice that my 30-year conventional mortgage payment is going to go up over {$50.00} due to estimated escrow changes. This is ridiculous.

I identified some items that I may have paid if had known about it but other charges were still not identifiable. I told NCS that I would agree to pay this amount if they would remove the negative remark from my credit score but the agent said she could not. Known of this was my fault yet my credit is penalized for a mistake that the apartment complex made and then correcting this is impossible because it was sold to a residential management business. A consumer should never have to pay for something that they do not owe and to be penalized for this {$210.00} does more to protect business than protect consumers. The burden of proof that all attempts to contact the consumer who is alleged to have not paid for something owed should be on the business.

I am asking that you please look at this unique situation of our moving in XXXX	1

So my only XXXX credit card charges on my monthly invoice were for that travel and used my 1.5 % points to timely payoff the balance of my account in full.

I now have a zero balance with Capital One Bank. I have not used the card since having a zero balance. On XXXX XXXX	1
I now owe interest. Coming again with the interest makes me sure that everything they have done in connection with this case has been a deliberate attempt to inflate the original debt. There are several complaints against this company and this law firm and it is time that someone stand up and stop their deplorable tactics.	1
I obtained documents from the court including PRA 's declaration and request for entry default judgment that I believe are false. Although I believe I might have had an account with XXXX Bank at some point in the past	1
I obtained the contract for this transaction and reviewed the time line associated with this fraudulent XXXX that was intentionally used to deceive the IRS. Based on the very contract that XXXX XXXX conveniently generated and by comparing the dates in her letter	1
I often get mysteriously disconnected despite calling from a landline that I NEVER have issues with otherwise.	1
I only got her voicemail. When a representative from XXXX called me	1

I opened a card over the phone and the agent ASSURED ME I would get XXXX miles if I spent {$3000.00} in a month. I did it but the miles never appeared. I called multiple times and was told they were looking into it. I finally got a supervisor called XXXX in Kentucky who told me I would not be receiving the miles. This is the height of deceptive advertising. The credit card company has no record of the people in their accounts opening department telling me I would receive the miles ( they say they do not record conversations! ). The company is also enticing people to spend money rapidly on a credit card ( for the miles ) and furthermore they will not simply close the card down and transfer the credit limit to another existing card in a seamless way. Closing the card and losing the credit line adversely impacts your FICO score. Consumer BEWARE.	1
I opened my own checking account with BOA in XXXX XXXX..	1

I owe nothing to XXXX and they never tried to contact me regarding a debt. My forwarding information has been included at every place I have lived and I am currently a customer of XXXX with no issues and all bills paid. I believe that XXXX is trying to fraudulently pursue a debt that was improperly issued by their billing system or ANFI is just fraudulently trolling for money. It is interesting that XXXX engages a debt collector for a mystery {$47.00} when I am currently paying them ~ {$70.00} per month and have probably paid them over {$1000.00} in the last 2-3 years and they have never	1

XXXX told me that there were XXXX open delinquent non-payments of {$90.00}. They had finally told me that I paid it off in XXXX of 2015 after telling me several times that there was no payment on that account. The reason for XXXX open cases is because they gave the collection back to XXXX XXXX and then XXXX XXXX asked for it again creating XXXX delinquencies. I was not aware of any of this during the years this has been attacking my credit. I now can not get approved for the car loan I want.	1
I paid the full balance by the due date. Out of my surprise	1
I paid the small balance immediately and canceled the card. I know XXXX and Chase keep adjusting the promotion	1

I pay my bills on time and only want to be treated fairly and for Citi Bank to honor its obligations just like I honor mine. That is not asking for too much.

I periodically receive late fee notices that are now nearly the amount of a payment. I have written to dispute this error repeatedly and in XX/XX/XXXX checked my credit and ALLY has listed me as XXXX thirty days late on a payment.

I am requesting/demanding that CitiMortgage write off the {$810.00} remaining balance of late charges. Their process was very misleading.	1
I was also told that I had to pay an additional {$75.00} with no explanation. At this point	1
I was always behind. Although I purchased my vehicle in 2012 for {$15000.00}	1
I was approved and received a good faith package in the mail. A week later I called XXXX XXXX to get details of what documents they would need from me but was told the loan was denied due to a pre-forclosure from American Home Mortgage	1
I was approved for a conventional loan	1
I was approved for trial loan modification payments of {$630.00} for the months of XXXX XXXX	1
I was approved. Once my income was secured I called up the collection agency handling the account to resolve my debt. They had agreed to a settlement amount of {$2300.00} vs. the balance of about {$3100.00}. I still only receive $ XXXX month so I asked if I could pay what I could afford toward this settlement amount. They said I could	1
I was asked for additional information and /or documents over and over again. This ridiculousness repeatedly occurred which pushed back the closing date several times and required me to pay for another appraisal and inspection. It also so happened that during this time there were additional hard inquiries pulled on my credit report without my consent. After six months of back and forth with XXXX XXXX and Residential Home Funding	1
I was asked to stay on the phone to help solve the problem with the insurance company and I told them that they could call me back when they had them on the phone. I had an appointment. No call back. After my appointment started the process over. The representative was rude and just wanted to not say they were wrong. 30 + minutes on the phone they sent the check to the wrong company.. my fault was the implication. They could n't find time to put a next day mailing to solve the problem. I drove to the insurance company and made the payment. Long story short	1
I was barely making enough to pay my rent	1
I was being billed for the box. I finally found the box in XXXX XXXX and called XXXX to see if I could still return it. I was told that once I returned the box	1
I was being charged an additional 20 days of interest.	1
I was being charged interest on a balance that should have been lower. Thus	1
I was being charged late fees of {$35.00} each month they "" received my payment late ''	1
I was charged XXXX XXXX overdraft fees for a total of {$100.00} to cover the {$12.00}	1
I was charged a {$35.00} overdraft fee for the ATM withdrawal. I should not be penalized {$35.00} fee because Wells Fargo incorrectly listed my available balance as too high. At the time of the withdrawal	1
I was charged an overdraft fee of approx. {$35.00} and a sustained overdraft fee of XXXX each day thereafter ( after 3 days ). The overdraft notices was not sent to the correct address ( mailing address on file was incorrect ). By the time I was first aware of the problem	1
I was charged because the company	1
I was charged finance charges for four months even though I had intended to pay the full amount due. I called Bank of America and was able to get the finance charges rescinded	1
I was charged {$100.00} for XXXX debit card transaction fees	1
I was charged {$10000.00} to the broker and what I was informed well after the fact the broker also made the yield spread on the rate of {$7300.00} for a total of {$17000.00} on a rate and term refinance. The purpose of this loan was to combine the XXXX and XXXX liens which were both taken at the same time when the home was purchased. This loan also had PMI for being over 76 % LTV according to the disclosures so this should be considered a conventional loan. HSBC contacted me to modify my loan back in XXXX of XXXX reducing the rate from 6.125 % down to 5 % but was a step rate modification set to increase to 6 % XXXX and then to 6.125 % for the remaining 40 year term which was extended from 30 years. So this modification was raising my rate higher than it even was. And extending my term. The modified loan amount was {$400000.00} after including an unpaid principal balance of {$400000.00} making the new money amount only {$3400.00} which was just a little more than XXXX payment I was due as they told me to hold off paying that because the refinance was going through. At the closing	1
I was charged {$19.00} on the XXXX ( except for XXXX in which I was charged on the XXXX ) and {$21.00} on the XXXX ( except for XXXX in which I was charged on the XXXX ). Again	1
I was charged {$31.00} in interest even though I had paid the entire bill in full! I was furious for an entire Saturday afternoon and honestly felt like I had been the victim of fraud. I still feel that way. I called Chase and the woman agreed to take off the {$31.00} in interest after a prolonged conversation because she said I had been a good customer. She said the {$31.00} in interest carried over from the {$340.00} balance that I had already paid. So basically	1
I was charged {$35.00} fee for late payment because after days and days of calling the company to verified my information	1
I was coerced into taking this loan because if I had n't	1
I was completely XXXX. However	1
I was completely XXXX. I had a similar problem some time ago with creditors	1
I was concerned that someone had fraudulently gotten my acct. number and had drained the account. When I called customer service	1
I was contact by the Homeowner that the property was in foreclosure which was owned by XXXX Bank at the time. In early XXXX	1
I was contacted by a representative who gathered additional information and started the process. Soon after I was sent a "" Good Faith '' statement which had estimated settlement charges of {$6100.00}. A few weeks went by and I heard nothing. I contacted the loan processor who e-mailed me a request for several documents ( 2 years of federal tax returns	1
I was contacted by my grandmother regarding a phone call she received. My grandmother stated that a woman called her claiming that if I did n't call her back today	1
I was contacted fairly frequently by many modification agents to have the information packet updated but ALL told me to save the money and not to make any payments until a decision was made. Whenever	1
I was correct and to ignore the letter. XXXX days later I noticed my account had the temporary credit was reversed a second time. So now I 'm out XXXX dollars	1
I was denied access to my account and was unable to pay. So I then called Lender Live and was told they sold it. After being put on hold for 20 minutes I was seemingly intentionally hung up on. "" XXXX '' was the Lender Live "" manager '' that I last spoke to after she contacted me concerning my first complaint and so that is who I requested to speak to before I was hung up on. I even left a message for a return call from a manager and once again it went ignored. Lender Live is completely and totally a mismanaged	1
I was devastated and in complete disbelief as to how my score had dropped approximately XXXX points. My credit score has always been in the XXXX range. I have the upmost integrity in paying my bills timely and take pride in having exceptional credit. The retail company accounts on my credit history have been closed for years with the exception of XXXX credit card I keep open. I understand from my bank that there have been no credit inquiries since XXXX. I obtained my annual credit reports and scores in XXXX	1
I was diagnosed with a XXXX XXXX. I had surgery and it took over a year to recover and be able to go back into the workforce.	1
I was disconnected XXXX times. At the end of the night XXXX assured me the account had been closed and the "" new card '' would not be sent. On XXXX XXXX	1
I was disputing the dates and validity of this account in collections. After sending a letter certified on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX with delivery on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
I was drafted {$350.00} twice in one week. Not acceptable to me ... ...	1
I was eligible for payments ; a borrower must have had a mortgage loan owned by the XXXX ( better known as "" XXXX '' ) or the XXXX XXXX ( better known as "" XXXX XXXX '' ). The loan had to have been serviced by XXXX and the borrower must have applied for and started a HAMP trial with XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX. The borrower must also qualify for at least XXXX Victim Compensation and Restitution Plan category. However	1
I was enrolled in credit monitoring services. This resulted in monthly charges to my account ( {$21.00} for Experian	1
I was eventually given a supervisor named "" XXXX. '' XXXX told me to call a different number : XXXX. It turns out that number does not exist.	1
I was exempt in that I never generated enough income to qualify for the business tax. Since this time	1
I was explaining that this had been discharged and the rep said in a very sarcastic	1
I was finally able to utilize other options. Unfortunately	1
I was finally approved through HAMP	1
I was finally connected to a live TD Bank customer service representative. I explained what had happened and that same TD Bank customer service representative told me that I had nothing to worry about as long as I made the deposit at another TD Bank branch	1
I was finally given an answer two months later in XXXX that my application was rejected. In the meantime	1
I was finally informed in response to the last e-mail that my "" calling benefits '' had been discontinued. At XXXX	1
I was finally told that my housing ratio was being calculated from the mortgage payment that was in effect when I missed my first payment XX/XX/XXXX ( my mortgage had an "" interest only '' feature that ended XX/XX/XXXX	1
I was fooled into accepting this with the understanding of a much higher amount	1
I was forced to accept the poor conversion rate.	1
I was forced to file for bankruptcy. Got back on my feet within two years but	1
I was forced to hire a law firm to protect my home. I would have never gotten in this mess had Chase/XXXX XXXX not told me to get behind on my payments. They told me it was necessary to be able to qualify for the hardship assistance. Then they played games with me. They told me they never received my paperwork even though I faxed and mailed and emailed it to them multiple times. Even when I got them to admit that they received the paperwork	1

I was full insured at the time	1
I was given a payoff amount	1
I was given the Chase representatives name and contact information of the Chase representatives superior. I made contact with the In XX/XX/XXXX I made a trip to XXXX. While in XXXX I contacted Chase	1
I was given the run around. I was passed around to different departments and given different reasons as to why I was denied in the end. After speaking with a manager	1
I was given vague answers and no definitive date of when I 'd receive my check for the balance of the account. SunTrust is well known ( online searches ) for this type of poor customer service and lack of transparency with account closures. Please send the balance of my account to the address on file.	1
I was had force insurance put on my home when I had insurances but I later found out class action suit because they were doing it to all there clients I believe this is fraud foreclosure.	1
I was hung-up on. So I called back and tried to explain how this account was supposed to be closed and that I 'm happy to pay for the items I purchased that they paid for including the overdraft charges for those XXXX items. The next "" manager '' said he could find no documentation that I had requested to have the account closed but he also could not find any of the information about the other XXXX checking accounts that I had closed and that I had for years and essentially said I was lying. I tried a few more times to get some information and talk to some other people and was asked to get a letter from XXXX outlining the items that were being submitted and returned and that if I presented this letter I would have better luck in getting XXXX more NSF returned ( there were a total of XXXX NSF fees that I do n't think I should have to pay and XXXX overdraft fees that I am more than willing to pay ). I offered each time to give my account information to pay for the outstanding items the bank covered	1
I was immediatly told "" no ''. I began making my payments late and the harrassing telephone calls from Wells Fargo employees began. They called at XXXX	1
I was in XXXX XXXX years market crashed. We continued our pursuit with countrywide regarding options to cure outstanding balance and saving our home on XXXX XXXX	1
I was in a Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy	1
I was in between jobs and was only receiving unemployment benefits. On XXXX XXXX	1
I was in the process of selling an old company	1
I was incarcerated from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. I have attached supporting documentation that I was incarcerated.	1
I was informed	1
I was informed again by a very reluctant representative that I would receive the credits on my next billing cycle. I requested that notes be made in the system to ensure no further confusion should the credit not post. However	1
I was informed by Wells Fargo on XXXX XXXX that my new payment was going to be {$1500.00}. When I called to ask where the extra {$10.00} was coming from I did not receive a clear	1
I was informed by my relationship manager	1
I was informed by that our auto-pay request was not transferred from dealership to Ford Motor Credit when we initially financed the vehicle	1
I was informed it was MY problem to recover my {$20000.00}. Of course vendor	1
I was informed that I made my payment too early and therefore	1
I was informed that I was named as a the responsible party now. During this time which reached through XXXX	1
I was informed that I was now behind on my mortgage as this payment did not show up. This is when the trouble began. Through various demands for payment and forced "" re-payment plans ''	1
I was informed that I would be contacted by a representative from the company	1
I was informed that My home was in foreclosure. When I asked why it was in foreclosure	1
I was informed that a check was not issued as I must have been given "" incorrect information '' that we would not be able to be the XXXX on the project and unless they ( Fargo XXXX received a new set of documentation	1
I was informed that because my previous modification took place in XXXX	1
I was informed that my account was sold to XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and that I should now settle it with XXXX not them. In the meantime	1
I was informed that my former spouse ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) had obtained this loan to include signing my name without any proper authorization. Several calls were made to XXXX to resolve this matter during which I was informed that there was a Power of Attorney ( POA ) on file. However	1
I was informed that the reason why my check bounced was "" inconsistencies with my signature. '' Although	1
I was informed that there was an escrow shortage and an additional payment of {$61.00} as a result my monthly payment was going to be {$6.00} less per month and would be extended by 1 year. XXXX XXXX my dedicated loan specialist told me I could request an appeal by mailing a letter and updated proof of income to Nation Star Customer Relations. It could take up to 30 days to receive an answer. I sent a letter with updated proof of income that was received by Nationstar on XXXX XXXX. Today XXXX/XXXX/2015 I called Nationstar and was told a letter was mailed yesterday. The customer service rep e-mailed me a copy of the letter that informed me that they made no errors and If there has been a change in circumstance due to reduced income	1
I was informed that they could not accept any credit or debit card payments. Evidently	1
I was informed that they were missing just a few documents including an authorization to release my Federal Tax Return Transcript	1
I was informed the check would take 10 days to clear which could involve further interest as this had to be verified by the lender. I requested to speak with a manager and initially told the manager was gone because they had already closed. Then asked to hold on for her to find someone. XXXX came to the phone and offered no resolution to the issue of waiving any fees and again assured me of the time frames of check clearance and the possibility of further interest accrual. She also informed me the request for a payoff was {$30.00} and the only way to get funds quicker was to wire the money or do cashiers check. Again	1
I was informed they would no longer speak with me and they were ending the call. I asked again regarding the credit reporting for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
I was informed today that it will take 10 days in order for me to get my money back	1
I was instructed to tell them to talk to XXXX XXXX ( benefits provider ). Despite this	1
I was instructed to write you with our concerns. The agent whom I spoke with was both very compassionate as well as helpful toward a possible resolution to the resending of the sale of our Home. We discussed my concerns of requesting the recorded phone conversations of which I provided the date of the agreement and proof of phone record lasting a full period of XXXX minutes which precede the date of sale ; This call ( in my opinion ) was proof of an oral agreement made between myself and Ocwen as documented within the complaint dispute. I assured the agent of our sincere understanding that	1
I was interrupted multiple times as well as I was told I MUST make a payment within the month of XXXX	1
I was locked out. This is ok if there was someone available Saturdays and Sunday 's to unlock my account	1
I was making payments everything was on time.	1
I was n't aware of the missed payment so I told them that I wanted to verify this myself with my local Gym. I was told that I should n't contact XXXX and that if I did n't pay that day	1
I was n't made aware of this at any time by XXXX until XXXX of 2013 as XXXX had failed to update my contact info. I have written to XXXX on more than XXXX occasion. ( sent certified mail yet they claim they did n't receive ) asking them to correct my info on my credit report. XXXX has refused to correct my account info and has given me incorrect and false information regarding my account. Other than this approximate 6 month stretch when the bank returned a check I had sufficient funds on	1
I was n't sure if there were any programs out there for me. I was rejected multiple times.	1
I was n't thinking about student loans - should XXXX have assumed that I would no longer pay after sending in XXXX of dollars. Should I be punished with a bad credit report because XXXX felt the need to send it to an unscrupulous company that hires people that slander my family member because they really thought I would give up making payments? Something really needs to be done	1
I was no longer responsible. This was sent to collection	1
I was not able to do so and was not able to maintain the ""loan modifications"". I went through several loan preservation officers and even at XXXX point had to resend all my paperwork	1
I was not charge a monthly fee.	1
I was not eligible for the promotion ... but because they promised the prior week	1
I was not in a place to get into an argument and even if I did it did n't matter cause he then hung up on me. I have XXXX	1
I was not in a position to cover the difference to make the deal happen. With the offer that I had	1
I was not notified of this hold by my other bank XXXX want the account to be reactivated and all my records and "" bill pay "" history to be made available to me. American Express and their offshore call center tell me all the info is never accesable to me again because this is or was an "" online Account '' I want my account reopened I have all my direct deposits paychecks ( XXXX ) being deposited directly and this will cause my money which I will have received this week to be blocked.	1
I was not notified that the account was closed nor did I receive a replacement card. They were unable to provide an explanation for the lack of notification on closing the account or the lack of a replacement card. The rep also told me that the amount of the purchase was {$65.00}	1
I was not presented with the 'Counter Offer Addendum ' until XXXX XXXX	1
I was notified by PHH Mortgage Service Loss Mitigation that my loan modification was denied because of too much expenses	1
I was offered XXXX loans	1
I was on a recorded line and they had me on tape saying I received it. I again stated I had not received a statement or acknowledgement of the dispute and I believed they could not report until they acknowledged my dispute and validated the debt. He told me they would report me over the weekend of XXXX XXXX if I did not make a payment	1
I was on hold for 10 minutes before I could speak to a human and then I was put on hold for another 20 minutes	1
I was only able to finally contact them via XXXX and was then directed to a call center in Texas that took more than XXXX minutes of hold time to actually speak to a representative. He told me I would have to go to the Social Security Adminstration for 'verification ' of my number. I called them and they say the do not issue XXXX. I am between a rock and a hard place. I have no delinquencies. I have XXXX active credit cards but it seems they do not report to Experian. There seems to be no solution on offer ... .and I appear to have a false black mark on my record.	1
I was only met with attitude by a male rep and was told to check my credit report for public records which I did while remaining on the call. All three of my credit reports displayed 0 reports on my public records. Then the representative suggested checking with DOJ or FBI or to hire an attorney because they had accurate information. So I saved up some money and retained as counsel The XXXX Law Group. No information was obtained by the law firm during their research and later an Engagement letter along with a signed Authorization Form by me was sent to CapitalOne around XX/XX/XXXX. With help of an attorney CapitalOne still did not provide further information regarding the legal action and it began to seem that only CapitalOne was privy to this legal action. By now I 'm experiencing XXXX daily. I am now out of money for retaining an attorney and still coming up empty handed ; my two additional accounts with CapitalOne which originated with XXXX were closed for the same reason and yet no record could be found. Then I began to think that even if there was something with the DOJ or the FBI that did n't appear on my public record how could anyone know without obtaining a background check which would require my consent and none was given	1
I was out getting groceries and they spoke to my husband	1
I was out of work for 6 months with no income due to denial of unemployment. My next job came XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
I was paying a note each month	1
I was planning to purchase a new home	1
I was provided misinformation almost every time I called in. Some examples include the individuals each time had to be explained the entire story and they would explain what their records reflected on the account and none of the information was what was actually discussed. They had indicated we had never requested reinstatement letter	1
I was put in a negative amortization loan	1
I was put on hold and then told yeah we got it page XXXX is missing. When we finally received paper work from them instead of offering us a modification	1
I was put on hold for 10 minutes and then told the entire management team was in a meeting. I was told I could not stay on hold and that the rep "" guaranteed '' I would receive a call back that evening. I have not received a call back. When I called back the next day and explained to the rep what my issue was	1
I was receiving weekly emails with status updates that were really no update	1
I was recently denied opening a XXXX XXXX for a XXXX XXXX Credit Card stating denied for "" Bankruptcy '' reported by Equifax. This file is at 10 years old and going on 11years in 6 months. Please help me I have been doing this for almost three years bouncing back and forth.	1
I was referred to the Special Handling Department who did not understand how to assist me. I was routed to a call center in XXXX	1
I was referred to their fraud department.	1
I was requesting to be reimbursed by XXXX XXXX XXXX for personal loans in excess of {$73000.00}	1
I was required to bring {$500.00} to closing and put siding on XXXX side of the property ( I have never heard of an appraiser requring work to be done on the property ). I objected to the last minute notice and the additional monies I would need. The WF rep told me that I could put 15 % down	1
I was required to wire the money at my own cost of {$30.00} or wait until Tuesday to get the money to XXXX. So	1
I was rudely threatened that I had to give the routing number to my checking account in order to stop being harassed. Still suspecting fraud	1
I was rudely told by their employee XXXX that XXXX letters were sent to me. I never received even one correspondence from Transworld. Neither did I receive any notification from XXXX stating that my account had been transferred to this collection agency. I request that they either show proof of the XXXX notification mails that they supposedly sent to me	1
I was scheduled for 'closing ' on XXXX XXXX 2015. During the 'closing ' I talked to Bay Equity personnel 3 times at numbers : XXXX & XXXX ; while in the process of signing all relevant documents. At no time during this process did Bay Equity personnel cite any derogatory complaints concerning the funding of my loan. As of XXXX XXXX 2015	1
I was sent a different fabricated move out inspection form which was inaccurate and had on it whatever the company decided to add. I then was sent a deposit reconciliation form with inaccurate and inflated charges. To which	1
I was sent to a notary about XXXX times to have the same new loan modification documents signed	1
I was served with forclosure notice. I contacted SLS	1
I was show a page stating I have to manually mail in a request form. Now I 'm concerned that someone has my identity and is opening and being approved for large purchases in my name. XX/XX/XXXX	1
I was still charged interest even though they claim interest would not be charged if payment in full is received before the close date. It appears to me	1
I was still charged the following month. They refused to grant my request!!! Then they kept charging be XX/XX/XXXX until I finally cancelled my card in XXXX XXXX. They kept calling me and harassing me. I told them I canclled them back on anniversary date which was XXXX XXXX but they refused to honor it. I then got a bill for {$100.00} on XXXX XXXX XXXX. A year way too late in which they finally agreed to cancel my contract. They decided to take it upon themselves to cancel it on their terms. I was told by their debt collection agency it was a 2 year contract now not 1 year like I was told by XXXX XXXX. This is outrageous and if you look them up on XXXX there are a ton of other victims of this horrible business practice. I am getting hit on my credit report for this injustice. I have warned my fellow agents about this horrible company. This company sent me emails in the spring of last year telling me I had to pay. I told them I could n't afford it anymore and was n't getting any results from their service. They threaten collection so I had to beg for an extension to pay XX/XX/XXXX for a service I was n't using cause they supposedly did n't get my request. But I should n't have to pay for something I cancelled on my anniversary date on XXXX XXXX. The Collection agency transworld system has been assigned to this. They already hit my credit rating and I have yet to receive this supposed invoice that I owe. I will submit the final letter from Superlative stating that they were sending my supposed debt to Transworld Systems Inc . Prior to that letter they tried to blackmail me for a partial payment on an email for about XXXX dollars. I can FWD that email to the person ( s ) that will be looking into this. I will just need an email address to send this blackmail email. This has been so stressful and very uncalled for..	1

I was still unable to pay the full payment of {$1400.00} and re-applied for another modification with Wells Fargo which was denied. So I just continued to pay the original modification amount of {$710.00}. Wells Fargo accepted these monthly payments for the next seven years. I got a couple of letters from them regarding my delinquency and bankruptcy in XXXX and XXXX but they still continued to take my payments. I got paperwork the other day for the beginning foreclosure process. My complaint is	1
I was surprised since I had not used the card in many months. When I called the Capital One	1
I was surprised to learn that the charge for stopping payment was {$35.00}. In my view	1
I was terminated from my XXXX where I was employed for over 18 years and had earned tenure. I filed a complaint with the EEOC in regard to the loss of my job. XXXX of the people named in that complaint last name is XXXX. I will attach a copy of that complaint. XXXX XXXX is the daughter-in-law to the judge whose last name is XXXX and who sits on bench in XXXX	1
I was then quickly admitted. I had been told that this issue could be from all of the XXXX I had put on myself from XXXX taking me out of my home and permanently removed from my family the year before. XXXX and the school liaison placed me on XXXX and onto the Oregon XXXX XXXX when I was removed from my home. I was unaware of needing to reapply at the time. I had decided to make myself an XXXX student and work full-time graveyard while continuing XXXX during the daytime. I chose not to go to XXXX XXXX because I did not want that as I did not hear very good things about the XXXX parents in that area. Little did I know that I would become XXXX Finally	1
I was then told the paperwork had not bee processed until XX/XX/2015 and it would be another 30-90 days until B 0f A sent the paperwork to my County. When I pointed out that it had already been 30 days since their processing	1
I was threatened with the police and to be charged with a felony and I know that type of intimidation is not allowed according to the Fair Debt Collections Act.	1
I was to be contacted by the company before any action was taken place. I just want the inquiries to be removed so that my scores and credit is not being impacted any longer. I would like to purchase a house	12
I was to move out within 30 days or by the end of the lease	3
I was to open it in a browser and follow the instructions on the screen.	1
I was told "" based on my experience financing units in your building	1
I was told "" who 's fault is that? '' and that they go through XXXX of checks and ca n't check all of the signatures. I felt that just because they ca n't look at all the signatures	1
I was told BAC had charged off the loan. Later	1
I was told Citibank handles that aspect	1
I was told I can not use the card for 7 days until it is activated and they can not cancel it until it is activated. Bottom line	1
I was told I can only "" deactivate '' an account and they would not absolutely confirm that my account and associated information ( including credit card info ) would be deleted.	1
I was told I could not withdraw my funds for 180 days. However	1
I was told I did not owe XXXX money. Then two months later the debt collection agency contacted me without any forewarning	1
I was told I had to make a lump sum payment for the 4 month period before the modification could be finalized. I made the payment and mailed the documentation. My certified check was returned and I sent it back. The lender denied the modification because they stated they did n't receive the payment or documentation. Subsequently	1
I was told I just had to have out of pocket expenses for repairs that were mechanical in nature	1
I was told I owed about {$87000.00}. The loan amount has constantly increased	1
I was told I still owed a balance of around {$5900.00} after the vehicle 's value had been applied to my account. I spoke briefly to a representative ( XXXX XXXX ) about making realistic payment arrangements	1
I was told I would be approved for the program as a courtesy and that the late fees would be take out because I had not been previously informed that I was not approved for the program. But now I would have to make XXXX new qualifying payments and the outstanding interest would still be capitalized for the previous XXXX qualifying payments and for the new XXXX qualifying payments. As such I will now be responsible for the difference between my old interest and reduced interest for 6 months or the amount will be capitalized. Had I known this I would have made the higher payments during the 3 months I was told I was making qualifying payments.	1
I was told I would received permanent loan modification.  It took 3 months for Ocwen to send me the new terms and conditions of the loan	1
I was told ahead of time that there would be no problem. I am XXXX and mobility is a major complication for me so I try to setup appointments ahead to avoid exactly this situation. Had they told me initially that the offer was conditional on prior accounts	1
I was told all customers who are overdue receive courtesy calls. When I asked the agent to give me the date and time of said call	4
I was told all or nothing	1
I was told because my payment was late. Clearly it was not. They waived the late charge but I 'm not sure they will report this correctly to the credit bureau. I need help getting rid of this loan and refinancing to a market rate loan. Please help.	1
I was told by XXXX that schools have a deadline to enter students names in the clearinghouse. My balance went from {$300.00} due to now {$600.00}. She also advised me that it takes XXXX days to clear my name. Which I know is a lie. While attending XXXX University in Georgia	1
I was told by a different SLS representative that they did not accept the updated information	1
I was told by a supervisor "" I 'm sorry I do n't know	1
I was told by co workers that this creditor had been calling everyday regarding my account being past due and which resulted in a verbal warning from my manager. I then noticed that the payment had never come out of my banking account. After contacting the creditor again	1
I was told by many people that money gram have some fraud going on.	1
I was told by the card 's benefit contractor ( XXXX ) that I needed to file separate claims for each receipt containing XXXX items	1
I was told by the person assigned to the account -- XXXX XXXX	1
I was told check was mailed out on XXXX XXXX	1
I was told he could n't speak with me any longer regarding my application. When I requested a copy of mu application I was told	1
I was told he could not speak to me telling me my account had been referred to an attorney. He was not able to give me a name or a phone number of the attorney. I was finally able to track down the attorney XX/XX/XXXX after many phone calls and internet research. I left messages for her for almost 2 weeks before I was able to reach her and when I did she told me that a repay had been set up and the first payment was due in 2 days. My mother who is on this loan called the attorney as I work and am unable to remain on hold for long periods my mother was told by the attorney	1
I was told in under the impression when I authorize charging my account for {$490.00} in going forward which included appraisals and other things which were never done! I never received an appointment from the appraiser or any communication except for the fact that you called me and asked me why I canceled the appraisal? News to me I told you	1
I was told it was a debt from XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$440.00} and previously had a high balance of {$520.00}. I then called XXXX and spoke to XXXX other people	1
I was told it was not enough	1
I was told my "" loan had been sent back to dealer '' ... I asked the agent why	1
I was told my card would be sent to me. I never received the card. Each time I called	1
I was told my offer was denied and they were not accepting any offers	1
I was told over the phone that is n't legal and when I asked about the escrow I was told I do n't get it back	1
I was told supervisors do n't work on Sundays and to call back Monday morning.	1
I was told that I could make the payment on the XXXX of XXXX and the payment plan would still be honored. I informed the customer service rep that I would be making the payment on XX/XX/XXXX. This information was noted in my account notes. I made the payment on XX/XX/XXXX using check number XXXX for the amount of {$1300.00}. On XXXX XXXX I made the XXXX and final payment of the payment arrangement. I noticed that my mortgage account had not been updated for some time. I I called US Bank Home Mortgage today ( XX/XX/XXXX )	1
I was told that I had a XXXX party mortgage lender that gave me a bad refinanced mortgage. I owed {$170000.00} on my home	1
I was told that I had to be transferred to someone else. After another XXXX minutes & telling my story again	1
I was told that I had to pay an additional {$110.00} to request a broker document before they remove the pmi or I have to wait years until the loan value is 78 %. They just gave me a bunch of other things to do. The problem is I work 14+ hour days every day ( XXXX hours just driving from XXXX to job )	1
I was told that I must wait until after the hearing to present any offer to them. That was told to me by their counsel as well at the hearing in front of the judge. Nationstar told me XXXX days after the hearing date when I called them regarding a deed in lieu / shortsale that I must have a minimum of XXXX days from the actual sale date to be considered for either. Obviously the math does not add up.	1
I was told that I owed XXXX. I have not had XXXX in 10 years and I do n't believe that XXXX would have waited 10 years to inform me about a debt. I left XXXX in good standing. My current credit score is XXXX. I am beginning to get really upset that I have to continue to dispute this false debt. It is negatively impacting my credit score.	1
I was told that I received incorrect information and that I would be called back that day as to when I would receive it. However	1
I was told that I should be able to do withdrawing the applications	1
I was told that Wells Fargo could not help us. The home preservation specialist told me that a majority of people are denied and that many people reapply and are approved. So	1
I was told that all I needed to start the review was a form XXXX that I submitted with a checkstub and my XXXX. Now 2 days before my sale date I am being told that they require a full file	1
I was told that even though I can have multiple Citi card acounts	1
I was told that if I paid {$220.00}	1
I was told that it was a mistake on the bank 's park ( my account was n't linked correctly )	1
I was told that the federal funds rate increased on XXXX XXXX	1
I was told that the first payment toward principal would not occur until XXXX and the second in XXXX.	1
I was told that the reason the taxes were not paid was due to the false allegation	1
I was told that the remaining balance outside of the short sale proceeds would be charged off in the amount of {$45000.00} and that I would be responsible for paying taxes via Form XXXX.To my surprise	1
I was told that they could not discuss anything with me because XXXX had not sent them all my paperwork. This is outrageous. Selene Finance has possibly the worst customer service of any company I have ever deal with. The phone is always busy when you call	1
I was told that they could possibly refund most if not all of the loan amount that was being taken out. It was also explained to me at one point when the amount was much higher than before that my previous semester 's tuition was combined with the upcoming semester	1
I was told that they cut a check XXXX XXXX	1
I was told that they did not have a user agreement or anything because the account was set through a third party ( XXXX ) in XXXX of XXXX. Since then the company XXXX XXXX has closed down	1
I was told that they extended the investigation another thirty days for the same item that was submitted back in XXXX. Now	1
I was told that they received my fax but nothing further had been done. This has resulted in a $ 500+ increase in my taxes. I do n't believe this organization is honest as the information on annual taxes are easily retrieved from the city 's website.	1
I was told that they were going to do an investigation and get back with me on the outcome. Instead	1
I was told that they were. I have struggled with this loan from the very beginning and have spoken with numerous representatives over the years concerning my hardships : XXXX being financial and the other a divorce. However	1
I was told the account was closed and I was getting nothing because of it. If the agreement contained information about getting points and redeeming them for credit to my card or other things	1
I was told the appeal was denied and still	1
I was told the funds were used for additional cost. There should not have been any additional cost as the State of Michigan paid them.	1
I was told the site is not down but that Loan Care 's site is not compatible with APPLE/Safari. Nowhere on their statements or web site does it give this warning. I am again after the 4th business day and have had to argue about their attempt to charge me to process on-line and auto draft payments from my savings account. Their fees escalate even higher on the XXXX day. This is a de facto late charge being assessed and does not agree with my note which states payments due on the XXXX and can not be considered late until after the XXXX. I have never been charged by a mortgage servicer for a payment process that is lower in cost and more efficient than mailing checks which is apparently what they want me to do to avoid their inappropriate late fee assessment. I respectfully request CFPB to instruct the servicer they can not charge me fees for "" on time '' payments. The web site issue is another sneaky way for them to catch an unwitting consumer in their process which all seems designed to funnel borrowers into paying additional fees to make on time payments	1
I was told there was nothing that their company could do as they no longer had information on the account	1
I was told they could not help me. From the company 's information it appears they assumed the debt after the SOL had past	1
I was told they could not provide that for their own security. They said they could email me information only. They provided a fax XXXX Attn : Arbitration. They stated that if I did not pay on the debt via credit card	1
I was told they did notify me with a letter telling me account was closed. What good does it do me to notify me after you already have closed my account without having the ability to reinstate it. Account closure letter dated XXXX/XXXX/15	1
I was told they have a policy to return call within 48 hours. That time has passed. I feel like they are not observing the foreclosure protections that have been put into place to protect homeowners by being responsive and finding solutions other than foreclosure.	1
I was told they were never going to re-affirm our mortgage. They do n't 'do that ' anymore. They are basically holding us hostage to their horrible company and practices as I was told by XXXX XXXX XXXX that without that written affirmation	1
I was told to fax my information at least XXXX times	1
I was told to pay {$700.00} for one year	1
I was told to wait because she was unsure of the current procedure. Teller informed her Supervisor	1
I was told to write an authorized to them to installed back my escrow insurance thinking that everything has been solved. Since then almost every two weeks or so Ocwen co calls to harass me with this case. XXXX times when I call to inquire we go through the same routine and spend almost 3 hours with them	1
I was transferred 6 times put on music hold by XXXX claims reps and XXXX customer NO service persons	1
I was turned down. The XXXX places that he tried to get me a loan sent letters to my house. XXXX was from XXXX XXXX the other from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX was Insufficient Credit because I do n't have any credit cards or not made any large purchases. Experian reported to XXXX XXXX that I had XXXX Garnishments	1
I was unable to acquire the exact address ( as they can only verify the address and not actually tell me what they had listed ).	1
I was unable to do so. I then sent them a check for payment in full for the last balance I could access. My check was returned to me with no explanation. This account was then turned over to collections in XX/XX/XXXX. It did not say that it was for Sears and after many calls to different collection agencies I was refused the information as to what account this debt was originally for. I refused to give my private info and pay a debt when I could not get the name of the original creditor. This month I received another letter from XXXX XXXX with all of the information for this account and it was the first time I was told that it was from Sears. I paid the balance on this through the collection company which was less than the check I had sent to Sears 4 years ago. This is ridiculous and should never have gone to collections. I have since called citibank and they have said they have no record of this account. I have been put throuhg a huge hassle and had my credit negatively affected by their poor customer service practices. I still have every email and letter that I sent to them. They never tried to resolve this matter with me directly.	1
I was unable to get to the store by Saturday when the sale was going to end. I then received another email ( from HHGreg ) saying the sale was extended to Sunday. On Sunday	1
I was unable to make a timely payment and was charged a late payment fee	1
I was unable to make the ballooned payments. I eventually worked out a payment plan with XXXX in XXXX XXXX. We set up a repayment plan for both of my loans with XXXX. XXXX withdrew directly from my checking account to post towards the loan. However	1
I was unaware of my mortgage transfer until Select Portfolio Servicing began sending to mail regarding my delinquency. I challenged their accounting record received from XXXX. As a matter of documentation	1
I was using this same card to pay for my vacation	1
I was very hurt in accident	1
I was very surprised to hear this. I have been told	1
I was worried something had gone wrong because where he was only paying {$300.00} a month I was paying {$1500.00}. I called Navient and asked them to look into this and I was informed that they had done something wrong with my application and my payments should actually be lower. However	1
I wasted a lot of time and money ( on a useless appraisal )	1
I went ahead and paid it even though it is not my responsibility since my mortgage is impounded for both tax and insurance. SLS is not a very professional company from what I have seen & people need to know to try and avoid them	1
I went back to XXXX XXXX to obtain a new loan that would reflect the current loan market. What do I find. The new credit report she obtained had the same XXXX late pays from a year earlier. BB & T failed to do their due diligence and I was having to suffer the consequences again.	1
I went in person to XXXX XXXX tax assessors office and the XXXX county tax office. At both locations I was informed that they had not provided SunTrust mortgage company with any tax information. And they did not have any idea where SunTrust mortgage was getting their information.	1
I went into XXXX to complain about the lack of service I was receiving in the new area I move to. The agent said their was nothing they could do about the service but would allow m to cancel. So	1
I went into a BMO Harris branch in XXXX	1
I went on my way and my co-worker stayed to receive the loan. About a week after I received in the mail XXXX credit cards XXXX for my co-worker and XXXX for me	1
I went online as I always had and they took off my online payment option. I sent them several emails asking them to fix this problem I finally gave up and sent in a check for {$15.00} ( 3 months ). After several months now	1
I went online to activate the new XXXX card	1
I went online to make a payment and they would not allow it. They said I had to register with XXXX XXXX and send the $ that way. This did not seem right	1
I went through the motions of a balance transfer and my Cash Plus was not available as an option. SO I called and spoke with XXXX at their XXXX number and she told me I could get around the issue by going to my online account	1
I went to SSA and did the XXXX. process required by Direct Express. When I called Direct Express back on XX/XX/1216	1
I went to XXXX store at XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
I went to a branch re my concerns that I had not got a response to my offer and that I still had not got the pre-approval from XXXX. I fear that PNC was discriminating against me because I am a single woman. I told my concerns to the branch manager ( XXXX XXXX ). XXXX attempted to call both XXXX and XXXX 's manager	1
I went to a dealership who requested my credit score. But I never signed off on requesting a car loan. Also Equifax have a lot of charge accounts on my report and I do n't. I do n't know what XXXX XXXX XXXX is and XXXX XXXX is a card to pay for reading glasses and other health expensive if I can get rid of the card I would but I need it for health issue if my insurance do n't pay for health issues.	1
I went to court and agreed to pay $ XXXX/month on the judgement for XXXX loan	1
I went to pick up my car and noticed that the check engine light that had been on prior to me taking into the shop was still on. At that time I was told to leave the car for futher diagnosing	1
I went to the TitleMax office located in XXXX office. I got a {$1900.00} Loan and the interest was 181.5559 % annual rate. By XXXX XXXX	1
I went to the XXXX branch on XXXXXXXXand went through the process to stop the check- signed the affidavit and Indemnity form- but since it was less than 90 days I was told the Citigroup Benefits Center also had to sign it- it was send to them on XXXX electroically by the branch. I called on XXXX and the Benefits Center confirmed they received the form but indicated they would not sign it as they do not sign "" third party forms '' -- this is a stop payment form from the bank they are an agent for! I on those funds. I am simply asking they sign the affidavit to stop the check so I can have it reissued back TO THEM and resend the payment for theme to process -- Yesterday XXXX after talking to the 5th supervisor and them opening numerous investigations they told me "" they can not sign the form that they have not received the check	1
I went to the local XXXX branch. The manger searched their database and could not find any records of their mailing to me. He also tried to see any unused promotion codes that he could apply it to me. He did not find any. I went back home and XXXX the promotion. I found that Huntington Bank website offered the same promotion but with {$150.00} incentives. I applied for a checking & saving account online on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Everything went smoothly. I forgot the {$150.00} until one day I received a message from the Bank	1
I went with my trust documents to setup the acct and was told by a rep that I had to close existing acct and had to reopen with new acct. I asked to talk to the manager who was not present there. I waited for 20 minutes and called Chase Customer Service regarding the policy and was told that I should be able to convert without closing the acct. The Customer Service rep requested to talk to the branch but the branch rep refused to talk to the Chase CS. Later the manager called the branch and requested to talk to me as I was on the phone with Customer Service. My husband explained to him about the situation and the manager denied my conversation regarding what he had told me on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and said if we are not satisfied with the service than go ahead and close the acct and take it to a different bank. I also have an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX and they were able to convert my checking/saving acct and put into a Trust acct without closing the existing acct. If both the banks are regulated by OCC and FDIC then why different policy. Please advise.	1
I will NOT pay anything in addition to the {$1300.00} I 'm currenlty paying. SLS has refuses to be transparent and my account is being mismanaged. Per my discussions with XXXX XXXX	1
I will also have to find time to do the remedy and prevent any damage to my future credit score. I do n't see any reason why they have to list the whole ss # in the document. I do n't see why they have to do it by mailing. I do n't see why THEY DIDN '' T CONFIRM MY ADDRESS.	1
I will be closing this unwanted PayPal credit account - hopefully	1
I will be forced to fail. I believe there are hundreds of thousands like me and the current laws are crippling my ability to pay at a reasonable terms and competetive rates. This is a travesty forced upon the American Public as a result	1
I will be forced to pay the AmEx membership	1
I will become delinquent. I do not want to ruin my credit or become delinquent on the debt.	1
I will call you at work. I attempted to tell him	1
I will contact them directly to sort out the situation	1

I will hand it over to my lawyer. I am trying to fix this before I apply for a new car loan in XXXX 2016. Thanks.	1
I will have ended up paying for the fraudulent charge twice instead of receiving a fraud reimbursement from Bank of America and the charge back XXXX	1
I will have to take legal action to protect my credit rating and myself. Which I 'm sure you are aware each violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows damages of {$1000.00} should this matter ends up in court.	1
I will make no further purchases from Sears. I thought they were reputable and would take quick steps to resolve this. The corporate escalations well as the stores are playing games. But this is not funny nor is it right. I wonder if the CEO is aware of how they are running this company. I 'm sure social media would have a field day knowing Sears and Citibank are scamming customers.	1
I will never use them as a credit card company ever again. The inconvenience and lack of flexability in their reward system will never earn the business of experienced credit card consumers such as myself again.	1
I will no longer be able to buy a car or finance a home.	1
I will only be receiving the lien release letter and that 's all I need. I 'm not concerned about that mistake	1
I will pay as soon as I get a address to pay it	1
I will receive XXXX from the I.R.S. a bill in the amount of {$50.00} K or so!! & lt ; & gt ; I did & lt ; & gt ;!!! I currently owe the GOV. {$50000.00} in XXXX gains tax!!	1

I wish I was given a revised disclosure showing my new rate	1

I woke up and checked my checking account to see an approximately XXXX-XXXX negative checking balance. Despite my account having been XXXX with Discover	1
I work for a non-profit so it is difficult to pay a quarter of my income over all the loans combined given rent and living expenses XXXX. These loans ' total balance has risen by {$5000.00} total. While working on my non-profit has the option of loan forgiveness	1
I work night shift I will get back to you ). Please look into this for me and let me know how I can be of assistance in helping resolve this issue. Like I said before	1

I worked with XXXX on the deed-in-lieu and executed that on XX/XX/XXXX & I vacated the home on XXXX XXXX as instructed by XXXX.. That document was never recorded	1
I would appreciate that	1
I would assume the debt collection would have begun a while ago.	1
I would be able to get it modified at rates close to market rates. However	1
I would be in a better position to find a renter if the payments were lower without me having to make up the difference between the rent payments received and my mortgage payment. She also informed me that the terms of the agreement would remain the same ( 13 years remaining on my mortgage ) ; however	1
I would be mailed a letter stating that the issue had been resolved. When I asked for a case number I was told the system had just crashed and I could call back later for the number.	1
I would be making payments to the new lender. This provided me with only 11 days written notice from my original loan servicer that my loan was being transferred	1
I would be served with papers the following day. They would not verify the name of the credit or provide me with any information that this was a valid debt. I sent them a letter asking them to verify the debt and also to cease communications with me and anyone associated with me. I have not received verification of the debt and they have continued to call. Today	1
I would be told we were near to closing/gather the documents/then be asked for some obscure documentation. This went on for months. I was told in mid-XX/XX/XXXX that we were ready to close. Once again	1
I would call "" Customer Care ''	1
I would call it highway robbery. The only interest due should be on the late amount and cash advances	1
I would call them to set something up. I told them to stop calling my family members in and out-of-state looking for me and asking them where I work when they have my direct contact information. They had called my wife	1
I would discover that Ocwen had failed to post the XXXX- month curtailment correctly	1
I would either use my ATM card	1
I would get different answers from different representatives etc. Nevertheless	1
I would get kicked out of the short sale process just to be put in again and start the process of faxing over again of tax returns	1
I would go to them since the lawyer	1
I would have been charge only {$38.00} instead of {$260.00} that day. I also feel that charging a {$38.00} overdraft fee for a XXXX or even a {$10.00} charge is quite over the line. I have attached copies of my online banking showing this incident. This is not the first time this has occurred for me but I am a senior cistizen livng on a fixed income and feel that I am being taken advantage of. I appreciate any help that you can assist me with in this matter.	1
I would have done so! They balance is over {$1800.00} at this point and I have no idea why! They also failed to include the other tenant in their collections	1
I would have expected them to work with their customers instead of thinking it 's just to raise interest rates whenever they feel like it just because the "" market dictates ''. My next step is contacting my senator 's office and then possibly	1
I would have had to know to go up to the top and select the "" Change '' link next to "" Payment methods '' in order to pay the traditional way. After that	1
I would have immediately worked to refinance XX/XX/XXXX before my FICA dropped so precariously low. I feel the original Rep was deceptive in not properly investigating internally how her own company would handle my credit reporting. And	1
I would have inquired further or declined the offer altogether.	1
I would have no recourse legally. First off I was denied a formal letter with information to be able to review and dispute. Secondly	1
I would have paid you an additional {$25.00} that I do not owe you. '' Then she told me "" that 's how the system works '' and got very short with me	1
I would have to call XXXX XXXX for that. Now the phone calls are continuing and I believe it constitutes harassment. My name is XXXX XXXX in XXXX	1
I would have to make a reservation at a higher rate. I did and my bill for the hotel stay was {$540.00}. The cost that I paid through Amex for XXXX ( value of {$450.00} XXXX. I want the difference {$90.00} refunded to me. Initially I was only offered {$100.00} off future booking which I refused. They later gave me a refund of {$450.00} which is still short of what I actually paid. I want the difference paid and an apology. American Express XXXX is guilty of not explaining that they use XXXX party booking sites and gives false information when speaking to their reps about receiving points at hotels.	1
I would have to pay {$1300.00} in interest charges. Obviously	1
I would have to use other assets. As a XXXX widow	1
I would have tried to find a way around defaulting. I was trying to do the right thing since I am in a legal bind and paying a lot of money to my attorney to fight for me in court. This really set me back by far. Now not only am I out this money	1
I would have used US Bank points for a trip in XXXX rather XXXX XXXX . In XXXX	1
I would like FCRA penalties and fines levied on NE Credit Collection and proceed with litigation. This is inaccurate reporting of dates and a debt not owed and should be deleted immediately. This is also a HIPPA privacy violation.	1

I would like an explanation on how they can do this. I am trying to rent a house	2
I would like for this to be completely removed from all XXXX credit bureaus	2
I would like my account investigated to prove this is true. They claim I defaulted on their adjusted terms that were not the terms I agreed to and signed which has since caused me to be ineligible for another HAMP review and qualification. Now I am again trying to see if there are any unspoken underlying cost factors that could come out after the trial period or permanent modification that would land me back in the same predicament as before	1
I would like supporting documentation including signatures showing I applied for credit and agreed to the terms and conditions on the account.	2
I would like them to note that the debt stem from the same nucleas of operative fact and are not indeed {$90.00} and {$150.00} collections	1
I would like to add that BSI advised that if the home did not sell within 60-90 days that they would accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure. They also advised that they would not hold me responsible for the difference whether its a deed or short sale. The realtor and BSI approved the short sale for XXXX and house was listed. Approximately 30-45 days later I received mail that a foreclosure judgment had been granted by the local courts. I contacted my realtor who advised that she would contact BSI to see if we could appeal to additional time to short sale the house. I never heard from her again. This week I received mail from the courts that BSI bought my home for XXXX. In essence	1

I would need to purchase an additional software bundle that would cost me an additional {$29.00} a month for the lifetime of using the unit.

I would pay more interest. Little did I know how my money was being applied. I apparently accumulated {$620.00} worth of late fees in XXXX and part of XXXX.

Nationstar has repeatedly denied us help several times for several years although we meet all eligibility criteria. They have never offered any alternative to foreclosure programs like short sale. Nationstar Mortgage illegally commenced and is conducting a foreclosure while reviewing attempting to find workout relief options for us. They have mishandled our documents and file several times and failed to properly communicate with us throughout the process. They simply wish to foreclose and kick us out onto the streets. They have clearly violated HBOR specifically under the "" dual tracking '' clause. Nationstar Mortgage instructed and allowed the Foreclosure Trustee named XXXX PROCESSING SOLUTIONS to illegally start foreclosure on my property. The Nationstar Mortgage and Know Your Options website gave the result that we are eligible for a loan modification with a lower payment to save our property. So there no reason why Nationstar should have denied our request or started foreclose on our home.	1
Nationstar needs to receive additional documents to continue reviewing your account for a modification. Your modification request is currently on hold and faces the possibility of rejection until Nationstar receives the additional required documents. Please return these documents as soon as possible.	1

Nationstar still has not provided us with the disclosures required by 12 C.F.R. 1026.20 ( d ) concerning the change in interest rate on the note.

Ocwen Loan Servicing contacted our bank and our local XXXX XXXX XXXX to say that Ocwen would only let us out of the mortgage obligation if we paid the entire remaining mortgage PLUS a $ XXXXXXXXprepayment penalty! Everyone at our bank and at XXXX XXXX were shocked and said none of them had ever heard of such a situation and it certainly sounded like predatory lending. We knew nothing to do about this situation until the recent XXXX XXXX article on the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. We have continued to pay this monthly mortgage fee so we do not lose our home and business. It is difficult and discouraging	1
Ocwen appears to have discharged the Note according to the IRS. This Note was discharged previously by IndyMac Mortgage Services in XX/XX/XXXX ( which Ocwen is aware of as the evidence of this was shown to them at a legal deposition ). Ocwen appears to have applied a court ordered use and occupancy payment made out to XXXX to a loan ( number XXXX XXXX which Ocwen pretends to have with me. I have received no notification that any loan was transferred to Ocwen at any time	1
Ocwen elected to start a foreclosure process by filing a Notice Of Defalut ( NOD ) on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Ocwen chose to ignore and disregard my appeal and proceeded with foreclosure process. This violates CFPB 's Dual Tracking Rules and California State Homeowner Bill of RIghts.	1
Ocwen finally proffered a loan modification for my acceptance which included an inexplicably inflated principal balance and the addition to my loan of a balloon payment at the end of the loan despite the fact that my loan never had a balloon payment requirement. The inflated principal balance that Ocwen maintained was still due on the account was almost {$5000.00} more than what the balance should have been for the loan according to the loans amortization schedule	1
Ocwen has always sent statements on or about the XXXX of each month with added late fees. I have complainant Ocwen of this Matter since XXXX.

Ocwen raises our monthly fee. We do the best we can	1
Ocwen replied to my complaint stating that they offered me a proposed mortgage modification with a balance reduction in XX/XX/XXXX and that I did not respond to the trial payments offered to me. Attached to the response was a copy of great offer that I never received by mail. I would have taken that offer! According to the response	1

XXXX XXXX denied the latest request. We are simply asking for a 12 day extension to close escrow and settle our account but the bank will not favor our request. The strange thing is that we were told if this was a short sale situation the bank has a policy in place to extend. My only conclusion based on that policy is that the bank and investor see an opportunity to sell our house at auction for more than we owe and come out ahead at our expense. I feel if this is the case it is not a consumer friendly practice and simply benefits the bank and investor. If they were willing to grant the extension and let us settle our loan we could also restart our lives without being in total ruin. I own the financial mistakes I have made and understand I put myself in this situation. I just do n't understand how the bank can have no compassion to simply extend us a few days to cure this issue.	1

XXXX. It has been over the accumulation of late charges and fees portion of the statements they have sent to us. Our Loan has been passed on to XXXX morgage companies in the past ten years. The last being XXXX XXXX. We had an agreement that a {$50.00} late fee would be applied to our monthly payments if we were late. When the transition took place Nationstar automatically said we owed XXXX in late charges and fees in a category included in our statement. I contacted them and told them to please get this corrected. That we have records showing all late charges/fees were up to date. With XXXX. Since that conversation XX/XX/XXXX the first month Nationstar took over. We have sent our {$50.00} late fee when applicable for being late. I have called them several more times about this issue in the last year. I got so frustrated trying to get someone to correct the problem I sent the fees along with my XXXX XXXX payment to balance this account. I sent my XXXX XXXX payment in with the {$50.00} late charge also since it was XX/XX/XXXX. Which should have balanced my account. I received a letter XXXX XXXX indicating that the money I have sent them. An accrued amount of XXXX for those fees real or added on has been put in suspense and they still are adding fees to my late charges when they are holding that money and telling me if I do n't sent another payment of XXXX for my XX/XX/XXXX payment they will send the XXXX back and add it to this XXXX. Making it look like I owe them XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX Plus more late charges/fees. My monthly payment is XXXX plus {$50.00} late fees. And that is it. I spoke with them today and asked why they keep accruing this Late/fee and keep charging me more charges and fees when they have this extra money that was sent along with my payments to clear these charges up. They said as long as I pay late at any time they are not going to apply these funds to my late charges fee to clear this up. I only owe XX/XX/XXXX payment right now. I estimated that if they pull this on a half a XXXX accounts out there ( which is probably a low estimate on the amount of mortgages they handle every month. ) and just XXXX dollars is tacked on to each loan in fees like this. They could be raking in XXXX XXXX dollars a month and no one would be the wiser. They keep asking me to send the money in and they keep accruing more charges on money they already have. I asked them again to put that money where they ask for it to be paid on and they refuse. These are the kind of things that XXXX	1

There was an escrow shortage in the amount of {$1100.00} with the monthly payment of this shortage to be paid over a five-year ( 60 months ) period. This monthly payment has been already included in the monthly escrow payment.

A few minutes ago I receive a short email from Western Union reading that this case had been escalated to higher department and that they would notify me when the "" investigation '' is completed.

I am a XXXX XXXX with the highest credentials and clearance working for the XXXX and a law abiding citizen and for this company to hold my hard earned money which my dad needs is inexcusable.

XXXX. They started harassing me for way more money than the loan was for in the beginning even tho I had been paying for it for a year or more. They finally offered me a settlement of XXXX % of what they said I owed and they said that they would mark the debt off as paid. I paid the amount they requested ( over a year ago now ) and never heard another word from them again until last week. I checked my credit report and there is no mention of any debt with them. ( XXXX had been on there when I did owe them money but all signs of it has been gone for over a year now ) Last week I received another letter from them telling me I needed to pay them off and offering me the same settlement that I had already accepted and paid off over a year ago. I am afraid to call them as that would just give them my number again but this debt has long been paid. I do n't know how to handle this situation. I read several things on the XXXX web site where other people are also facing similar issues with National Credit Adjusters. All of their responses to the complaints people have submitted to the XXXX are all exactly the same and they have had their XXXX membership revoked for failing to attempt to resolve problems with customers. Can you please advise me on the best way to handle them? I really do not have the money to keep paying their settlements every year or so and I really do n't think that it is fair to demand to be paid again when they said they would accept the XXXX % that last time as full payment of the account. The original loan with XXXX was a total rip off that is next to impossible to get out of in the first place	1
XXXX. They told me to go to XXXX to obtain this letter. In an attempt to get this taken care of I went to XXXX personally to ask for this letter. XXXX advised me that it was ILLEGAL for them to give me a proof of payment and funds from the issuers account. I went back to Wells Fargo to inform them of the illegal action they sent me to do.

Still I thought the situation was unusual. When I received the letter and check I called Citibank 's customer service line.

after the three months then the arrangement will start that 4th month. My first automatic payment came out on XXXX/XXXX/15. I waited a few days and called XXXX/XXXX/15 to figure out why my account showed past due. I spoke with a rep who informed me that after the qualifying months I would not show any past due balances.

again in Pennsylvania	1
again in XXXX	1
again informed us that they were changing their organizational agent. My mortgage payments were always automatically paid by our bank for many years. We have never been late. While in the process of changing the address and other information for the new agent with my bank	1
again is only being allowed to continue its erroneous reporting on Experian. They have not responded nor updated since XX/XX/XXXX and I have disputed the paid in full account 3 times in writing by certified mail with Experian and still they have not updated or removed the account. I have asked them to validate their verification of the debt and they have ignored my request and only send the same response that ignores my legal request as a consumer. They are obviously disregarding the law and your authority by doing this	1
again no response. I feel that this is a deceptive and abusive practice on the part of Department Stores National Bank ( Macys ). This is blatant attempt to increase fee revenue on a customer that pays their bill in full and on time. I could understand if I entered the information incorrectly ; however	1
again not reflecting our payments. I made regular payments to them on a monthly basis. A woman from the agency contacted me and proposed a settlement agreement. ; if paid {$210.00} for the next 3 months	1
again rudely expressed that I was a horrible person and began yelling at for trying to explain myself and the reasoning behind the missed payments. I asked to speak with a manager and it was not any better	1
again there was no explanation. I was a good costumer at the Bank and doing small but growing investment with XXXX XXXX.	1

I told her I wanted it correct immediately. She replied that it would take XXXX days to get the issue sent to their research department. I told her this was not sufficient as I am in the process of applying for a loan. I asked for a case person who I can follow up with as well as a case number and she said there was n't either. As you know	1
aggravation	1
aggravation Ocwen put me through.	1
agreed that I never lived at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX	1
agreed to refinance my loan including my collection costs and put my payment at XXXX. He advised my employer that we had worked out an agreement and to stop the wage garnishment. My employer was unable to comply	1

all I 'm looking for the little help to save my home. I see the balance on my mortgage getting bigger and bigger with the fees and the late charges please help.	1
all I got was the run around for the past 18 months!	1
all I have left is a {$650.00} credit limit credit card to buy food with. She did n't care and forced us into a payment plan. I honestly just wanted the harassment to stop! We could n't afford to lose our only reliable vehicle and feeling hand cuffed we entered an arrangement under severe duress!	1
all I need to do now is to make three ( 3 ) trail period payment plan	1
all I want is for XXXX XXXX to remove the information from all XXXX agencies because they no longer own the accounts ant the XXXX is reporting the same info with different account numbers. XXXX account # 's XXXX and XXXX all the information is the same on all the accounts see attached documents	1
all I was asking was why this account is still showing in my name and has it been closed/marked as fraud and removed from my records. The representative and manager I spoke with refused to provide any such assurances because I would not provide my personal information to "" verify '' the account. I did provide the information on the statement but apparently thats not enough. They claim to refuse to provide me with this due to their security verification protocols but its a shame that they didnt do this when opening the account with the fraudster. I have no accounts with Discover and certainly never will based on this horrific experience.	1
all XXXX judgements came back as verified by the XXXX County Court. I have proof from the court system that there is no reocred judgement for XXXX and XXXX	1
all agents that I talked to were wrong	1
all along promising all is well	1
all attempts to rectify the situation have failed. My husbands lawyer only says keep mailing or file bankruptcy yourself. That some creditors will not recognize the bankruptcy as far as co-debt and the only way to get them to stop is to file bankruptcy myself. I should n't have to and do n't want to do that.	1
all bill payments scheduled were not sent although I had positive balance. When Wellsfargo processed return check transaction	1
all charges worked up for the XXXX XXXX doctor 's visit. I offered to pay the amount of my typical deductible	1
all day when I work overnight shifts. Now I have to turnmy phone completely off to get sleep..	1
all docs. A few weeks later they told me that it is actually better to stay on current loan payment because changing over to a fixed interest rate would raise my payments by almost double. Regions Bank told me it would be cheaper to keep my current loan. So in my trying to get fixed payments to lower my balance Regions told me that its less expensive to keep what im paying now than to convert over to a permanent loan. Well i have paid about {$15000.00} towards this loan over the last XXXX years and my balance has only reduced only about {$800.00}. So Regions keeps charging me a service fee	1
all in good standing with very low utilization and perfect payment history	1
all included in the payment. For Example : Regular monthly amount of {$2100.00} and monthly late fee amount of {$66.00} for a total payment of {$2200.00}. The payee ( Borrower )	1
all initiated by me. ) I sent them my certified documents ( about XXXX pages in total over the last month ) stating who I was	1
all is complete but I found out yesterday XXXX/XXXX/15 that the escro was not going to be returned to me. The escro	1
all it did was start my mortgage over again as if I 'd just walked out of settlement. I 've gone through bankruptcy trying to keep this property out of foreclosure and all this bank tries to do is sabotage this mortgage every chance they get. I received a notice telling me that I have not fulfilled my modification agreement and that the property will be entered into foreclosure. I have spoken with an M & T Bank representative and have asked for the latest date my payment can be in that bank	1
all menitoned they removed all charges	1
all mortgage payments in arrears ( {$15000.00} XXXX were paid through the plan - Exhibit XXXX. "" Notice of Final Cure Payment '' was sent to CitiMortgage XX/XX/XXXX describing the same - Exhibit XXXX.	1

all my loans ( except for XXXX ) were coming from XXXX XXXX. Now looking back it is insane to me that we are asking XXXX year old kids	1
all my payments were going to the little purchases made instead of my promotional balances. The extra charges that I made on the credit card were no more than $ XXXX ( bare minimum finance charges that would bill ). I am highly upset by this. I would have rather the little $ XXXX {$5.00} finance charges billed than be billed over {$700.00}. I thought this type of payment hierarchy was against the law	1

all was set -- so I thought. It was only myself and the salesman in the store ; he kept hugging me	1
all were from previously paid medical expenses paid in full by the XXXX of witch I also just confirmed paid in full. I have a strong feeling that this company is targeting VA payments that do take some time	1

and 'late charges ' to the 'account balance '.	1
and ( c ) the {$18000.00} MSRP of the exact vehicle as previously listed on a website linked to the dealer. Documentation is submitted with this complaint in the form of a cache of a web page linked to the dealer where the exact VIN of the vehicle in question has an MSRP listed at {$18000.00}.	1
and ( local grocer ) for {$7.00}. I checked my balance online the morning of Tuesday	1
and 1 time {$560.00} which totaled {$3100.00}. I reported it to my bank and they were shutting my card down and going to send out fraud papers. So later that night we got on the onlline bank again to make sure nothing else happened and they had transferred XXXX to my checking account out of my savings account. I then callled us bank back and told them and they said ya someone called and we thought it sounded fishy so they put a freeze on my account. 4 days later I still did n't receive fraud papers so i called the bank back and they said oh we will get those out today. So we finally recieve them and they had the wrong date of fraud they have XX/XX/2015 and it was XX/XX/2015. so we filled it out and faxed it back right away. days went by and we called and they said our money will be deposited by the XX/XX/2015 at midnight. So we looked XX/XX/XXXX and there wasnt anything deposited. they said our claim was denied and would have a claims adj call us within XXXX to 5 days. So she did and she said it was denied because I gave them my pin number which i didnt. She then replied well our people do n't lie and said there nothing we can do. I asked if i could appeal it and she said no. so i went into a local branch and she called the fraud dept because she did n't understand and the fraud dept rep we talked to there said he would have a supervisor look at our case because he did n't understand it and they would call us within XXXX hrs so we called back after not receiving a call and they said its because of the tapes and they still did n't give our case to a supervisor. so they said they would and get back to us within 48hrs. Its now XXXX/XXXX/15 and it happened on XXXX/XXXX/15. we have gone through the holidays with our account frozen and no debit card. plus our money that is gone.	1
and 10 months of payments I was served with foreclosure paperwork. I was told when I started the Modification Process that Ocwen would help me lower my payment and apply "" capitalization of arrearrages '' to my loan to make it current as soon as my trial period was over. Now almost XXXX full year later	1
and 14 years later I 'm still paying and ca n't get an accurate history of what I have paid.	1
and 2. i told him we would n't be paying anything until we got the detailed bill.	1
and 4 ) She not once said this was an attempt to collect a debt. She said she would email me my documents ( I requested ) if I emailed her first. At this point	1
and 5 months of paying interest on these fraud charges	1

and BB & T Bank website noted it would take at least XXXX payment cycle before my payment would be automaticly drafted	1
and Bank of America chose to either take the payments and hold them in escrow or to process the payments and send them back to me.	1

and CBI subsequently calls me weekly	1
and California 's Homeowner Bill of Rights.	1
and Capital One refunded me the amount. After XXXX XXXX	1
and Chase 's advertising is both slippery and false	1
and Chase has not provided those records	1
and Chase held up insurance payments to me during rehab of the property	1

and Equifax requires no legal proof to add whatever the companies tell them to add	1
and Equifax. See Exhibit A. XXXX and XXXX immediately deleted the federal tax lien from my credit reports. SeeExhibit B. Equifax however ignored the notice	1
and Executrix of my uncle 's small monetary holdings. He passed in XXXX 2015 at the VA nursing home. When I went to the XXXX County Courthouse in XXXX	1

and Federal Debt Collection Practices	5
and I 'd like to have it removed from my credit report regardless.	1
and I 'm assuming did n't pay the bill. They are now contacting me and placing derogatory remarks on my credit report.	1
and I 'm guessing have resold the car since. Yet	1
and I 'm not being permitted to make principal payments or having my credit report updated so the abuse continues even after repayment has occurred.	1
and I 'm not even located in XXXX XXXX	1
and I 've accumulated XXXX dollars in XXXX fees over the last few months. There 's no human effort involved in moving my money between my linked accounts XXXX which I setup specifically with overdraft protection )	1
and I 've received NO response from the agency.	2
and I advised him he was not welcome there and do not come back. People come there to workout with memberships and he violated so many of my rights and privacy. When the owner started walking to the front	1
and I again applied for a credit card. The answer continued to be "" no	1
and I again sent a certified mail response which received no reply. Now on XX/XX/XXXX	1
and I already explained the situation XXXX times to different people. they never put notes on the system	1
and I also mention I will be homeless by XXXX XXXX she was so inconsiderate and detached from what I was telling her. Again	1
and I also submitted a code to obtain XXXX Citibank "" Thank You Points '' upon completion of qualifying activity ( which consists of paying XXXX bills online for XXXX consecutive months ). ( These points would be worth {$520.00} in airline tickets if I booked through Citibank 's travel website	1
and I always get the notice that "" user name not found ''. I then click on "" Forgot user name ''	1
and I am XXXX years old with a mortgage	1
and I am a single mother of XXXX kids. I do not have any plans to move for at least 5 years	1
and I am being harmed by XXXX Bank employee XXXX XXXX	1
and I am being told no one can help me. She has bank accounts with XXXX plus	1
and I am confident that bank cameras captured this event as well as the prior incident. It also appears to me as if this is a racially motivated incident	1
and I am fully requesting that this credit mark be reviewed and removed promptly as inaccurate. Secondly	1
and I am in the process of trying to refiance my home and this is when I found out	1
and I am not sure whether or not it is true that the other provider did not have an orthotist at that time ( I trusted XXXX at the time ).	1
and I am now XXXX. The net result is that the household has a mere fraction of the income that it enjoyed at the time the mortgage was initiated.	1
and I am now demanding that Santander close my account	1
and I am on time with all of them	1
and I am still unaware of where this policy is written on the AMEX website. It also seems unintuitive because the category-by-category tool has more than XXXX categories ; I ca n't believe I am the only person who has attempted to divide payments by category.	1
and I am still using 39 % of my income to pay my Principal and Interest	1
and I am still waiting for the bill. Why should my credit score be damaged seriously by something that is XXXX 's fault?	1
and I am suffering irreparable damage as a result. Indeed	1
and I am sure I never used my name with "" Z ''	1
and I am unable to avoid this additional fee. I am hoping the CFPB can look into this issue	1
and I and XXXX for just my boyfriend. We discovered this when the cards came in the mail. I am very displeased with his behavior and conduct. He was VERY deceptive and obviously had every intention of opening accounts. He took advantage of us being first time buyers	1
and I ask that in order to protect the public at large and prevent these immense institutions from basically garnering more fees improperly into their coffers that your organization look into to this and take any appropriate actions necessary. XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX made XXXX XXXX in overdraft fees so this is a very lucrative avenue for the banks	1
and I asked for XXXX XXXX to provide the application with my signature. They refused to provide any documentation. Around XXXX	1
and I asked her why would she call security when i just wanted to withdraw my money. She then instructed her employees to walk away from me and leave me in the cube and not tend to my request. She then told me she was calling the police. I do n't know if she did	1
and I became upset and also displayed my ignorance. She hung up the phone and I called back to speak with a supervisor and they transferred me back to her and the argument started again.	1
and I believe Ocwen has a target on my back. Ocwen refuses to fix any mistakes they made like failing to finish processing my loan with an affadavit submitted to dispel any accusations of irregularities with signatures. Recent HAMP offers only address payments and not the underwater principal loan balance. I made it clear that I already have a XXXX agreement in force and that they insist I submit new modification paperwork. I clearly marked on there that a HAMP will not fit my circumstances	1
and I believe that that is the amount of overpayment which should have been returned to me.	1
and I believe the Truth in Savings regulation should be updated to no longer allow any overdraft fee greater than the amount actually overdrawn.	1
and I ca n't attend school. AES will also not grant an in school deferment to me. I have contacted my congressman	1
and I ca n't get another card to pay off a high interest card with a no interest card. The new ones in question are from long ago charged off credit cards from XXXX. I am attaching a letter sent to them to inform the credit card companies of the charged off nature of the XXXX accounts. They are from XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX.	2
and I can not get PennyMac to assist me with online account access to view my mortgage information. When I called support	1
and I can not open other bank account on my name	1
and I can prove it! They also have reported me as being XXXX payments late. Also	1
and I cant try to come up with money from family and friends to settle this loan	1
and I contacted XXXX XXXX to make repayment arrangements that I could actually afford to pay : Campus Partners was demanding $ XXXX	1
and I contacted XXXX on XXXX separate occasions	1
and I could be fired if he continues to call	1
and I could not find her. I left several messages and nobody called me to give me the status of my mortgage even my appeal or the status of my modification. I even called XXXX	1
and I could not make the huge payment. We tried to renegotiate and get back in good graces	1
and I could not reach them by phone at all. I tried about XXXX times that day	1
and I declared bankruptcy to get rid of old personal debt. Clearly	1
and I did	2
and I did n't submit for a loan	1
and I did not agree to this. There has been not documentation or evidence presented to me showing that this is an agreed or allowable method in collecting payment. Thus far my payments have been timely so there is no reason for me not to continue paying on the balance of the loan. However	1
and I did not receive any of the money from the sale of the vehicle unlike my former wife. Despite my repeated requests to delete this account from my file	1
and I did so to several different numbers provided by different customer service reps ; but no result. The reps refuse to provide their names or ID numbers	1
and I did.	1
and I disputed the information with all XXXX credit bureaus to get them to update my credit file. On XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
and I do n't believe they verified anything at all	1
and I do n't have much money. Yet bank of america makes {$100.00} in fees off me every month	1
and I do n't know that everyone is treated fairly with that sort of attitude. Can you tell me if there are government guidelines to charged off type loans or does the servicer/investor have to provide us with those guidelines. Seems strange that it is left up to XXXX person to determine the future of a borrower with no regard to any sort of guidelines. Guess if that person is having a bad day the borrower is screwed.	1
and I do n't know where to go.	1
and I do n't understand what 's going on. I just ca n't lose my home to foreclosure. I do n't owe but {$14000.00}	1
and I do not qualify to receive any part of the rebate check ( s ) I will not owe Penguin Insulation that portion of the Total Amount Financed. '' I think I did all I could to try to get the rebate but I am not going to cheat on my taxes to do it. I called penguin insulation multiple times to try and resolve these issues but after 2 years they instead sent me to debt collections.	1
and I dont hear from them until they pass the debt to another collection agency. Then is starts all over again	1
and I entered the account reference # from the voicemail and my zip code	1
and I explained that my loan agreement gave me 5 years to pay off the debt and if I did not within XXXX	1
and I feel this was a deliberate violation of the fair credit debt collection act. I am filing this complaint because they have violated the fair credit debt collection act with their false credit schemes.	1
and I fell into foreclosure. The mortgage at some point shifted from Litton to Ocwen	1
and I filed a complaint with this agency. The XXXX time they made a bogus collection call was XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I had sent a check one week earlier	1
and I find out with a letter from my insurance company. I should also mention that my monthly payment has n't changed	1
and I forgot to inform Citi about this change	1
and I found out that the car had been charged-off. Capital One never once called me	1
and I gave One main financial the number to freedom debt to call	1
and I gave out my bank account information to set up the monthly payments	1
and I got the issue resolved. It was a mistake on their part. The account had been written off for service issues	1
and I had TD certified bank checks that needed depositing ( void after XXXX days ). The TD checks were rental checks in the amount of ( XXXX-check number XXXX and $ XXXX-check number XXXX ). The problematic section XXXX tenant	1
and I had another item. They took the larger item first which overdrew me {$1.00} and then the lowest item. If they had taken the lowest item first	1
and I had been told that they are going to investigate	1
and I had completed it in good standing. This was 15 months later. My loan never left garnishment. Now they want me to make a second payment every month after they have already taken the money out of my check. I just went back to college	1
and I had made no such loan	1
and I had no knowledge of the debt or the service prior to the letter from CBA. The letter references a XXXX XXXX	1
and I had no way to verify if it was legitimate. I decided I would not deposit the check until I had discussed it with my bank	1
and I had plenty of money in the account	1
and I had to get a lift from the cops just to get home way across town	1
and I have NEVER been	1
and I have a dispute I want to check with Equaifax	1
and I have a dispute I want to check with XXXX	1
and I have a major problem with that.	1
and I have been denied from their insurance company	1
and I have been reported as late on my credit report	1
and I have been told that only XXXX of these qualify ; the terms exclude size or color in the determination. However	1
and I have been turned down for new credit.	1
and I have called repeatedly and written to their corporate offices as told to by their customer service dept to get this reapplied.	1
and I have called the debt collector and still my debt has not been removed or marked as paid on my credit report. It is the only debt I have and it is stopping g me from moving forward. They have not helped me at all	1
and I have confirmed this by speaking with Caliber 's claimed attorney and also by checking routinely with my court clerk 's office. In other words	1
and I have disputed the information with all three credit bureaus stating the allotted time has past and the accounts were paid in full. The returning investigation shows that the derogatory information has n't been removed but only updated. The first delinquency for the months of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX 2007 now have been blacked out and report back "" NO DATA ''. I have contacted both creditors asking why they have n't held up to the agreement made on the last court date. I have suffered with this on my credit report for the XXXX years	1

I have contacted both creditors asking why they have n't held up to the agreement made on the last court date. I have suffered with this on my credit report for the seven years	1
and I have even mailed them directly	1
and I have made every attempt to send my statement back within a couple days of receiving the bill. Customer service was no help at all and said they are n't even required to send me a statement?? I think they are intentionally dragging their feet on processing payments to charge huge late fees!!	1
and I have most of my bills taken out automatically. However	1
and I have n't been there in five years. Credit report is showing as of XXXX 2015. Incorrect date and fraudulent charges.	1
and I have never had a failed transaction. BECU prides itself as a CREDIT UNION	1
and I have never missed a payment in all the years of that I have used this line of credit. For many years the balance was XXXX to XXXX. Last year	1
and I have no cash for my daily life. Please help me. My family is dependent on my finances	1
and I have no power to negotiate with them.	1
and I have no proof etc.	1
and I have not received a document that validates these fraudulent accounts. As a victim of identity thief it is very important that these item be removed. Under FCRA section 611 ( a ) ( 7 ) a consumer has the right to ask for a receive verification documents within 15 days of an item being verified. My letter being sent XXXX/XXXX/16 asking for these documents is over 15 days old. Where are the said documents? My log in date for Transunion is dated for today. Still these items exist on my profile and still I have received anything from Transunion. As of yet	1
and I have not received anything from this company.	1
and I have only XXXX Credit card which is fairly new and never been in arrears. This company uses many illegal tactics and should be stopped.	1
and I have put a block on my phone for their number. I ran XXXX credit reports and there is no XXXX account or any other suspicious activity. The number they are calling from is XXXX.	1
and I have spoken to XXXX. And was told by XXXX that this matter have been resolved. I spoke to XXXX Regional Offices.	1
and I have to submit proof of receiving mail at my primary address. The only bill I receive at my primary address is my trash collection bill	1
and I have waited on hold for hours at a time. It appears as if they have nobody actually available on the customer service line.	1
and I just received a letter stating that they received my request and that it would take place after XXXX XXXX. I may lose my loan interest rate and may even have to start the process over due to my mortgage company failing to fulfill my request withing the XXXX business day period they told me it would take when I inquired about if over the phone in XXXX. My broker urged me to file a complaint and stated that this activity is illegal. The request for mortgage payment history should not be delayed for months. I have been having trouble with my mortgage company improperly handling situations for years now. In XXXX I applied for a mortgage loan modification after the economy downturn	1
and I just received the response attached XXXX XXXX never hear from the other XXXX collection agencies again after I sent the disputes and assumed that it was resolved. I have attached all of the documentation regarding the XXXX disputes. It seems that US Bank continues to sell the account to different collection agencies after I have disputed it. US Bank is charging me for merchant services I never received. They did not send me a credit card machine	1
and I just want Experian to remove the incorrect information from my report.	1
and I know that we are not alone in this. Please Help!!!	1
and I later discovered there are NO notes on my file other than that I called on XXXX XXXX	1
and I make a payment on XXXX XXXX	1
and I may have suffered adverse consequences to my credit report because of their credit inquiry and ultimate rejection of our loan application.	1
and I missed payment	1
and I most certainly did not sign it.	1
and I must confess that I did not keep my books very well in the past. I would sometimes cash my pay check and pay some of my bills before depositing the full amount in the bank account but after being denied for this reason	1
and I need my appraisal before my loan lock expires.	1
and I needed ARA 's license number to confirm that they can legally do business in Maryland. She asked me to hold	1
and I never had a phone number or voicemail linked to their company. What she said was a complete lie.	1
and I noticed on my checking account statement they if fact had been making a monthly withdrawal. Several months after my auto payments scheduling	1
and I notified XXXX of this by phone in advance	1
and I offered to pay XXXX even payments of {$320.00}. He said that he only got approval for the settlement if I paid it by the end of the month. I told him that may be but it was his issue that he went to his client with a proposal that I never agreed to. I said I suggest you take this to your client.. He said he would. This was yesterday	1
and I paid $XXXX of $XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. How was I a month behind and still had possesion of the vehicle if a Notice of Rigth to cure was sent in XX/XX/XXXX that I did not receive.If I had been notified properly	1
and I paid the historical monthly amount. I noted the error the next month	1
and I pointed out the information and she said oh yes	1
and I provided proof of that fact on more then XXXX occasion. I also have a saving account that I had opened at the same time as the checking	1
and I provided the authorization number received from TRANSWORLD. XXXX XXXX said that their system did not show any payment or credit card information. XXXX did check with her supervisor	1
and I receive daily collection calls for me being at "" default '' with my mortgage payment. All this is not true as per above my mortgage is paid in a regular basis in full by automatic withdrawn. I made a complain to the president of the company about this situation early XXXX. No conclusion. The letter received on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX tells they are still investigating where is my money. Definetely the book keeping is very bad or somebody mingled with the money : they are unable to give me a decent explanation of why they stop applying the payments to the mortgage and kept my monthly payment twice. I figure now in their books that I pay about $ XXXX mo and change instead of my {$840.00} send monthly from my bank account. The result of this messy book keeping affects my credit report as I figure in pre foreclosure proceedings. None of the representatives I spoke with is unable to track down where is my {$790.00} send in XXXX	1
and I received a packet in the mail that said that yes	1
and I received no notification of this activity. The representative again stated that she was unsure how this happened. I was directed to the fraud department and they asked me if I had participated in a scam or if I had given out my information to anyone I stated no. The fraud team stated that the person would have had to know my XXXX security questions	1
and I refused to pay the {$5000.00}. I wrote to them that they were mistaken	1
and I reminded him that they were already sent	1
and I reply I call you back. ( the reason I said I call you back	1
and I said no they told me I should have report it and I did. The law office was provided with old credit report to show that I had a fraud alert on my credit and I also provided police report to both XXXX	2
and I sent XXXX a check for 5 of 31 days billing	1
and I should consider the matter resolved. Then on XXXX XXXX	1
and I should not receive any additional calls from this credit management service. This was not the case	1
and I should see it most likely within 3-5 business days. She explained to me that the managers can request this on behalf of customers	1
and I signed off on the applications ( as I always do ) as the XXXX of our company.	1
and I spent the first month of employment working at an location who had no previous affiliation with the school and whose method of operation was horrendous. I was hired at my current location based on a recommendation by a previous classmate. This location had an affiliation with the school and offered a loan repayment incentive for all graduates of XXXX. Career services	1

I was hired at my current location based on a recommendation by a previous classmate. This location had an affiliation with the school and offered a loan repayment incentive for all graduates of XXXX. XXXX services	1
and I stated again that Wells Fargo and the collection agencies that they have hired know not to call and he acted like it did not apply to him and kept harassing me with conversation regarding a debt	1
and I stated again that XXXX XXXX and the collection agencies that they have hired know not to call and he acted like it did not apply to him and kept harassing me with conversation regarding a debt	1
and I still have not received the refund. I contacted Citibank again today and they told me that there is a possibility that I will NOT receive a refund	1
and I think that more than two weeks should be enough time to be at least acknowledged by a live person from Navient.	1
and I thought I was. Now we are stuck receiving minimal help and poor credit. Embarrassing!	1
and I told her {$3000.00}. I asked about the interest rate and she told me that be calculated based on my records.	1
and I told him yes. He asked if he had permission to continue contacting me on my cell phone. I told him no. I received the following calls at the following times : XXXX XXXX	1
and I told them it was due to someone trying to attain credit fraudulently and I did not authorize the inquiry.	1
and I verified this with my credit report. I am thinking this may be in regards to my son	1
and I very much would like to clean up my credit totally and move forward with our lives	1
and I want to either load my card or have them mail it to me.	1
and I want to know where every penny is? I received a loan mod from Greentree	1
and I was barely making ends meet before losing my job. So now I have to file an appeal with more supporting documents	1
and I was charged a {$30.00} return check fee. There were sufficient funds in my TD Bank checking account to cover the check	1
and I was correct. It seems their escrow department failed to collect and pay my Private Mortgage Insurance since the inception of the loan. I was a little irritated that I did not receive a phone call or letter explaining the mistake.	1
and I was forced to drop out	1
and I was further charged a {$2.00} fee from my bank for the refused check.	1
and I was given a check for the {$3500.00}. When I received the loan papers in the mail	1
and I was guaranteed to make money	1
and I was not able to pay my bill until the next day. This made my payment XXXX day late.	1
and I was not allowed to have it per my landlord/tenant rules I was unaware of which deemed my contract null and void. My chapter XXXX bankruptcy was not discharged until XXXX of 2014 so even if this all had not happened I would still owe XXXX nothing. They continue to send a bill to collection agencies	1
and I was offered XXXX insurance. I then search to see if Synchrony bank provided for other cards and came across the lawsuit against GE/Synchrony bank. Based on what I read	1
and I was on a XXXX min break I just wanted to set up my payment she told me if she could n't talk she was going to end the call and hung up. I called back and requested to speak with a manager and asked them to cease all call	1
and I was on vacation meaning it would be XXXX before I could have the funds to deposit and then I 'd need for my bank to clear them. The letter I received which I thought was confirmation of my cancellation was a non-specific notification of "" a change ''. It turns out the draft date changed from the XXXX of the month to the XXXX. That is not what I thought I did but I had no way to know that because the letter was vague and I never got any notification of a new draft date or amount. I did not plan for or expect to have a double mortgage payment. Nor did I think it should take several phone calls and over 2 hours to fix. My initial call to PNC was on XXXX. Eventually they promised to wire the funds on XXXX and said they 'd be in my account by XXXX. Today is XXXX	1
and I was paying what I could	1
and I was ready to drive there to make immediate payment ; only to find that the branch has never existed	1
and I was reassured by both CMRE and the hospital that everything was taken care of.	1
and I was sent a secure message from "" XXXX '' telling me that they received my request and are working on it- I have received no response since then and no agent for service has been provided.	1
and I was supposed to receive a disbursement check of {$950.00}. The check was supposed to be sent by overnight mail and I was supposed to receive the check on XXXX XXXX. As of today I have not received the check	1
and I was told I was grandfathered in for free checking. Recently they charged me for free checking	1
and I was told that First Progress does not have a customer service email address but I could have the number to someone else to see if they knew the email address because "" they 're	1
and I was told that I could apply for a refund if I did n't want the product. I was then told that I would be called back in a day or two to discuss the matter.	1
and I was told that this was "" never offered to me '' and that they refused to agree to the pre-agreed deal. As such	1
and I was told they could not help me	1
and I was told they would get a refund from the county for the over payment in taxes and recalculate my mortgage payment to the correct amount.. We asked the representative of the Mortgage should be just make the previous payment or wait until we received a revised statement. The bank representative advised us to wait until a revised statement was issued and then make the payment shown of the new statement. We were further advised that the bank 's records would be notated and no collection efforts would be made because it was the bank 's error and without a revised statement there would be no way for us to know what payment we should make. Needless to say it took the mortgage company two months to straighten this mess out	1
and I was unemployed. With the help of my parents	1
and I was worried for the safety of my granddaughter and grand babies. I asked him to fax me the documents to prove that she indeed owed this money to somebody. He refused to send me any type of receipt. I then called the credit card company to cancel the transaction	1
and I will have to have them run another escrow analysis. They will then send me a check that I do n't want. I will then attempt to send them back the money since I want it in escrow and they will mess that up again. The circle continues this way with no end in sight. I have contacted you before on their incompetence and nothing is fixed with this company. When do you plan on fining Nationstar? When will they be shutdown? Can you force them to switch me to a mortgage servicer that knows how to service a mortgage?	1
and I will probably get another one this evening	1
and I will write to my congressman	1
and I wondering if the transaction even was run at all since they knew it would be in default if the payment was missed. I asked them to work with the creditor who placed the debt to settle for the final last payment of the agreement	1

and I would be receiving correspondence that would provide some level of clarity to the situation.	1
and I would like their so-called "" hard inquiry '' removed from my credit reports.	1
and I would like to be refunded for all towing fee 's alone with the two months in advance of payments. Plus the remainder of the loan debt to be cleared of my name	1
and I would n't be able to do so if I would n't made that deposit.	1
and I would need to go back through all my statements to see how long I have been being charged for this fee. I have had the card for while now and do n't remember ever being notified that I would be charged a {$3.00} member fee when I took out the card	1
and I would not know the difference. All the numbers are on the contract. This made me so angry I do not want the car I do not want to deal with those people at XXXX Kia. When I left there I went to another dealership and will be leasing a car from them. The reason I am writing this complaint is because how many people have they done this to and get by with it? They would have made a {$1500.00} profit from their deceit.	1
and I would pay it. But they can not. My complaint has been open for over 100 days	1

Because XXXX is the only agency that has a telephone number to resolve issues. I made a reinvestigation with XXXX only ( ref # XXXX ) XXXX at XXXX stated that there were no notes regarding the billing history in their investigation.

I complained to them about the fact that we had responded to everything they had sent in a very timely manner and that we had never received the papers they were referring to. They then sent the paperwork out	1

and XXXX sends me a FINAL NOTICE regarding the hazard insurance. They were going to force me to buy insurance from them. I called ditech again and requested a supervisor who finally informed me their concern was insurance for the structure which is paid by the HOA. I faxed them what they wanted.

Now as of XX/XX/XXXX the account is showing as a charge off again reflecting a balance of {$18000.00} as if the settlement never happened. I called in to Synchrony Bank on XXXX to inquire about the account they told me they could see the settlement and this is a reporting mistake due to the changes with the Bank. That they would correct the issue and delete the trade line off our credit reports. One since the account is so old and two all the issues we have had. I was told to fax a letter to XXXX addressing the conversation we had and do a letter explaining the situation. I did on XXXX. I was also instructed that if I did not hear from them to call in 7 days. I did not hear from them so I called today XXXX and spoke to a Manager by the name of XXXX that told me he would not help me that if I wanted to dispute this I would have to refax all the information to XXXX XXXX in Charge offs to see if they would agree to update any of the information. He did confirm during our conversation all of the information I have provided regarding the settlement and that they did receive my fax with the explanation. We are tired of trying to get this updated when we did our part to settle the account paid what the boat was worth. We feel this is an issue with the bank not reporting the account properly. We paid the {$8000.00} they agreed to accept as payment in full now our credit report is not showing this closed and settled but as a charge off again for the full balance. It needs to be deleted completely off our credit reports or shown as paid in full. How it is showing now is inaccurate.	1

On XXXX XXXX 2015 I sent allianceone Inc an email requested debt verification	1

I called XXXX billing department this morning and was told they have no recorded of receiving this information and that it could take up to 2 weeks so I just needed to be patient. I am incredibly doubtful that sending the same information to XXXX as I did 3 years ago will cause them to take any action towards removing this fraudulent collection from my credit report. I have exhausted all resources I possibly can to clear this up and the Company again is refusing to act. I am attempting to purchase a home and this collection has SERIOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT to my credit score. XXXX is costing me money	1

and advised them to please send me documentation to my address at the time XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and advised them to return the debt to the college since I do not owe it and would not discuss the matter further with ConServe. I was abruptly informed that they would in fact continue to pursue me for the debt until I paid. I was then badgered for a further XXXX minutes in an attempt to bully me into paying the debt which I do not owe. Immediately following the call I sent a written Cease and Desist letter and mailed it off to their address found on their website. Since that time I have not received any further calls	1

How can the court have judged against me? How can Martin & Seibert in XXXX WV continue these shady collection practices	1
and again XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. To date (Sunday	1
and again on XXXX XXXX	2
and again on XXXX/XXXX/15 which they then paid.	1
and again they removed it. Now I am refinancing	1
and age. XXXX	1
and aggravated at this point.	1
and agreed it was not sent.	1
and al that is needed under the law. I signed all documents. Then they started to ask me source of deposits. I did not go to XXXX myself for close out. I send a power of attorney ( submitted to bank ) to my brother who was a buyer. Two days ago I received declined with reason "" we can not verify the Residence '' I do not agree with it	1
and alerts of large withdrawal on an account that I DO NOT have with this bank. I have contacted them a number of times	1
and all American Express does is state it is correct	1
and all I needed was employment verification. My impression was that after this was submitted	1
and all communication came from my instigation. It took me over 4 months to get through the process	1
and all credit card companies	1
and all debts were cleared. The number they called from XXXX.	1
and all extra food expenses	1
and all interest charges would be reversed. Upon calling today	1
and all late charges were reversed. This shows we were never late	1
and all payments would remain the same. I began making monthly mortgage payments to Carrington XXXX XXXX	1
and all related property insurance and homeowners ' or condo association fees	1
and all responsibility would be on her name and SSN. After feeling confused and discriminated by XXXX XXXX XXXX about my status in United States and having no help as to what is right or wrong to do we agreed to do it her way. So we signed some documents from which we never got official customer copy as every Wells Fargo branch does and were assured that everything is ok and were prompted to go. On Thursday the XXXX of XXXX I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX XXXX and the purpose of calling was that in the banks system there was some error about our recent request. So she insisted again with accent that me and my wife went back to XXXX XXXX branch to sort out her mistake. I refused to go back and told XXXX XXXX that I will go to a branch near my location to find out what is the problem. On Saturday the XXXX of XXXX me and my wife visited Wells Fargo branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and all the tricks. we fell victim to green tree 's predatory lending practices and it did n't take long for us like many other to be "" underwater '' in our loan	1
and alleged owner of my loan	1
and allowing the XXXX to rip other consumers off with misleading and confusing charges on their kiosks ( XXXX ). I am holding XXXX partly responsible because they program their kiosks to mislead customers at these restaurants. XXXX said he would kick the matter to his Corp. dept. and let me know. XXXX would not refund their erroneous charge to me. I was very polite and did not raise my voice the whole time.	1
and also a matter of public record. Also	1
and also advised to get a monthly statement	1
and also ask the Customer Service rep to please confirm my payment will not be late. Now there coming back with all this false data. Any other type of loan I have you can still pay on the date your payment is due prior to cut off time for the company.. Can you please tell me who I can speak to in regards to getting assistance with this matter.. I am in the process of refinancing my home and this is a major impact that they have been reporting incorrectly as well as updating the bureaus incorrectly. I have proof of that as well ... I want to know how can a creditor report you late on the XXXX day and give Customers 30 full days. They are not following the full statement from the Credit Breau ... Now they want to threat me that if I continue to question them they will add all incorrect information that had previously reported correctly ...	1
and also had to buy me food and personal items. I finally got my money on the XXXX XXXX after being told that the card was to be locked for one day XXXX XXXX	1
and also have my business account there	1
and also lost the appeal	1
and also placed me into the worst APR bucket at 23.24 %. An account was opened and they initiated the balance transfer. Here is the problem - AT NO TIME DID I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO APPROVE WHAT THEY OFFERED ME. If I had known they would not approve the full amount	1
and also spoke online with one of their reps tonight. He said he would refer it to their main office. I have a copy of the main page as well as the online conversation I had with the rep. Unfortunately I ca n't get it to scan where you read it clearly.	1
and also the social. When I asked what does ERC do	1
and also threaten take me to court if I do n't pay.	1
and also to inquire about settlement options. My then current account representative	1
and also was had me placed with a property manager XXXX XXXX that was very mean displayed racism to me every-time i called. an spoke to XXXX XXXX who advised me that as long as someone moved into the home after me and took over the lease i would not be responsible for the rent. I moved out in XXXX and another couple took over the lease the next month. They were not only staying in the home the month of XXXX 2013	1
and alsoa partial payment on my account. I should have had an ending balance of {$40.00}	1
and altering the contract to their benefit. Also by telling me that the vehicle did not have a cutoff device with GPS. I feel that by tracking my vehicle everywhere I went	1
and am an active member in the community. I really enjoy where I live	1
and am not getting anywhere with them. I feel that if they are demanding this amount of money and from me that they need to prove ownership without a doubt since there is an issue with the dollar amounts. There is also something on XXXX of my credit reports starting in paid {$100.00} on this account XXXX 2013 and XXXX 2013	1
and am reporting me delinquent for XXXX separate accounts which really are the same account with a higher erroneous account balance!!! I have also requested that I be provided a copy of the mortgage Note	1
and am trying to manage the situation the best I can. I currently have no recourse with which to resolve this issue	1
and am unable to view the account to see if those payments are over or under the amount due. My last payment of {$800.00} was sent on XXXX XXXX	1
and am under no obligation to tell them that I am not the person they are hunting.	1
and am willing to pay XXXX by money order to complete this transaction.I was not aware of this payment length until after I signed.The charging of the payment on opposite weeks also caused my account to be overdrafted.	1
and amounts. From XXXX	1
and an "" Important Message '' email from Conn 's. To me this consuetudes harassment	1
and an adjustment of my loan to reflect that amount.	1
and an extensive XXXX	1
and an extremely transparent	1
and an itemized written estimate of repairs from the contractor and a properly completed XXXX form from the contractor! Then they will send out their own adjuster and check and then they will pay the builders. In the meantime	1
and an option for a third party call was not available. When I told the rep this	1
and an outstanding balance.	1
and an unwillingness to correct any errors. Here are some of the numerous errors that effected my account:1 ) Balance Due : My initial statements listed my balance due at {$150000.00}. This was over twice the amount I owed ( $ XXXX ).	1
and another false positive fraudulent activity alert was sent to me via email.	1
and another late fee.	1
and any and all other laws. I am asking that you intervene and ask Transunion to remove all late pays as they have payment history 's in their file and further make clear to them that they can not re-add negative information to a credit report without notice to me. I have reviewed all letters from Transunion and can find no communication regarding this. Again	1
and any other information that they have to prove that this account belongs to me and they will not even respond. Instead of responding to my requests they continue to report this fraudulent information to the credit bureaus. Westlake has done nothing at all to prove that this account belongs to me. I have sent Westlake Financial Services a copy of a police report	1
and any other pertinent information that is being used to ascertain the validity of this account.	4
and any other pertinent information.	6
and anything of value we had to keep out of foreclosure	1
and apologize the phone call -- but the CALLS KEEP COMING!!!	1
and apologized for their mistake. 8 months later we were notified that the original mortgagor XXXX Mortgage filed for Chapter XXXX. When the new mortgagor took over XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and apologized for their mistake. They also charged us {$30.00} for each and every time the Title Company called for a payoff balance. 8 months later we were notified that the original mortgagor GMAC XXXX filed for Chapter XXXX. When the new mortgagor took over XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and apologized for their mistake. They also charged us {$30.00} for each and every time the Title Company called for a payoff balance. 8 months later we were notified that the original mortgagor XXXX filed for Chapter XXXX. When the new mortgagor took over XXXX XXXX XXXX	2
and apparently "" that information was not in my account. '' I asked them to once again send both the affidavit and the bill. While waiting again for them to send this information	1
and apparently they ignore the information on their own bank provided remittance slip.	1
and apply bulk of the principle to XXXX 2016	1
and appropriate standards for executing documents in foreclosure cases	1
and are	1
and are dragging their feet.	1
and are not remitting our money.	1
and are now trying to lie and say that I made a payment online	1
and are refusing to let me draw out my money! This has caused my mortgage to bounce because I need my money!	1
and are unprofessional. It should not be this hard or long to get this resolved and documentation regarding status of this account! This is unacceptable!!!!	1
and as I am a young father of XXXX children who is preparing to purchase a home that is dramatically impacting my life. Please remove these bad marks from my record as I never received the bills.	1
and as I recall	1
and as a consumer I was looking for payment relief in order to get back to financial health. I never heard from them as a result I am paying a mortgage payment {$200.00} higher than previously with a balloon payment in addition. I have made payments on time and am paying more than the payment amount. I just want a reasonable rate with a lower payment. I am XXXX and may not be as solvent in the future.	1
and as a result	1
and as far as we can tell it is not. Also no paperwork has come in the past 10 years in regards to this supposed debt? They continue to harass me and family and job. I want to report this as a scam or a fraud or at the very least	1
and as of today	1
and as such	1
and as such I participate with XXXX County Texas ' "" Property Tax Deferral Program ''. Much like those programs in other states	1
and as such they were not to communicate any more to me other they to state the debt was paid in full. They are trying to blame my payroll department for not calling them	2
and ask MERS Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems	1
and ask for a forbearance	1
and ask them for a paper check. The problem now is that the SAME number is for both the service company and for Santander! Catch XXXX. I consider their scam is to get me to sign up for a credit or debit card ( now in my hands -- a debit VISA ) that I do not want	1
and asked about late charge. According to the customer service person	1
and asked for a divorce which left the houses without anyone to look after them	2
and asked for a manager. We spoke to a XXXX XXXX. She was extremely rude and nasty.	1
and asked for copies of receipts etc with my signature. At this point they are refusing to provide any other information to validate that this is me.	1
and asked for my lease copy. My realtor sent both Ally Bank and their lawyer	1
and asked how they received a garnishment order without a court order. She said it was public record. I asked her to forward me a copy of the judgement. She declined. I have medical issues that are exacerbated by stress and I just wanted to be done with this nightmare. I offered {$1000.00} but she declined and countered with {$1200.00}. ( The most I have ever owed HSBC was {$630.00}. ) I agreed and offered to pay with a debit card. She refused and said she HAD to have my checking account routing and account number in order to make the agreement. Against my better judgement	1

She refused and said she HAD to have my checking account routing and account number in order to make the agreement. Against my better judgement	1
and asked them by phone and mail to cease calling me. In XX/XX/XXXX they called again. I sent a XXXX General Law 93A letter	1
and asked them for debt verification	1
and asked them how much money I should send in and whether I should send it to them or send it to PNC Mortgage ( the company taking over the loans on XXXX XXXX ). They said I should send in {$18000.00} and said if I send it before XX/XX/XXXX	1
and asked them to apply the amount necessary from the over-paid account to the past due account to bring it current. I now make to separate payments each month to keep the overdue balance from getting larger. But despite my efforts and multiples calls	1
and asked them to prove that the debt is valid. I even disputed it through XXXX. They have never shown any proof that this is a valid charge. I have never received a bill in this amount from XXXX and when I had service with them I was on auto payment so I always had a zero balance. XXXX years after I cancelled my service I began to receive calls from them. I will include copies of letters that I have mailed.	1
and asked to speak to a supervisor	1
and asked what debt and for whom? I received an email response which gave no answers but appears to be a fishing expedition.	1
and asked why do they continue to contact me. I was informed that the last payment to XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX. I informed Midland	1
and asking for ways in which we could resolve the problem with lower payments. I submitted the letter on Wednesday	1
and asking that they provide a response to ensure that I was emailing to the correct address	1
and assigned Case Number XXXX. '' "" After a thorough investigation	1
and assigned the debt to a XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). Here is the problem : Synchrony bank NEVER called us. This {$38.00} charge was being mailed monthly to some ambiguous address and City and zip code some XXXX miles away from us	1
and assumed I was managing my student loan debt as responsibly as I was able. This however changed when my cosigners bankruptcy ended and I was sent a bill for a payment I could not afford.	1
and assure me that the fee wo n't be charged on the next billing cycle. But it does appear on the next cycle. For more than a year now I have had to go to my local branch	1
and assured me my auto billing would still go through	1
and at XXXX in the morning I had a direct deposit come through my bank. They said I did not have enough money on the XXXX Knowing that I had a direct deposit coming through in the am ... something needs to be done about this how can you overdraft knowing there is a deposit coming through hours later. I think this is very confusing the way they are doing business	1
and at XXXX point the automated message says	1
and at present I am debt free.	1
and at the same time precludes the notion that I gave Venmo incorrect account info.	1
and at the time of appointment receptionist should have told me this. I have been trying to resolve this problem for almost one year.American Express have open this dispute XXXX times and each time they claim that they will investigate	1
and at this point we are very frusterated and would like a work history report on our file and this matter escalated who can diligently review our case for loan modification.	1
and at worst fraudulent and deceptive.	1
and attempted to even illegally obtain a judgement against me in XXXX County Court. I had to fight them for approx. a year against their illegal practices	2
and attempted to work with this person on the phone as the Seneca Guy kept threatening with a 30 days late. To us this is a very serious Threat since Hubby has near perfect credit. We had made our payment early in the month just like always.Our bank got back to us in just days and said the Check was Returned Undeliverable. How does that even happen? The Bank checked with us on the Address again to be sure it was sent correctly	1
and authorized	1
and bank stamens ( multiple times ). Every time I call them I ca n't get any information. Now they tell me I 'm in foreclosure after I have sent all these papers in. They tell me that someone has tried to contact me but I have no voice mails from them. This has been going on for about a year and no resolution. Please Help.	1
and bank statement for XXXX accounts used. For each missing progressive deposit	1
and basically said that there was nothing they could do. This left me in the position of having to pay for XXXX months insurance out of my pocket to prevent the cancellation of a policy that had been in effect for well over 5 years. After several phone calls	1
and be done with it. The credit card companies presumably have recordings of my telephone conversations which should confirm all that I say. No mention was ever made of any more money due than the amount they gave me	1
and be restored back to normal status. With that in mind	1
and because I was making reduced payments	1
and because my experience with them until hours ago	1
and because of these XXXX companies terminating their relationship my check was cashed by Loan Care and they will not release my funds until I provide them proof of payment from my bank. How can an organization XXXX Loan Care XXXX cash a check that they knowingly shouldnt? Shouldnt they reject the payment? Now	1
and because they will not assist me	1
and becoming dedicated to my education my period of financial aid lapsed and I was forced to apply and get private loans through XXXX XXXX as an independent student.	1
and been given incorrect information. I was only able to receive the loan modification offers through the help of multiple elected officials and the Massachusetts Attorney Generals Office. Now Santander gets me to sign one set of documents	1
and before I was introduced she spoke to her assistant in front of me in XXXX ( she did n't realize that I spoke some XXXX ) about my situation. I asked her about the situation in XXXX and she told me that she could n't give me any information. The only information that she gave me was that they had me moving out on XXXX ( mind you the debt collectors reported "" my '' debt to the national credit bureaus in XXXX ) and she said "" something about carpet. '' She did n't furnish me with a list of infractions or anything	1
and blocked all online access permitting me to see balances. and blocked online banking so I can not make payments. They would not give me the account balance when I called in	1
and boarding up our windows! All of these never happened as we were living in our home and there is no record of anyone checking into our property during those times. You see we live in a gated community that requires check-in at a guard shack	1
and browser requirements and setup are exactly what is required. I do	1
and budget letter. We were told to send them XXXX mortgage payments and not contact Mortage company since they would be handling the modification. In XXXX is when we found out this was a scam and Dovenmuehle sent us a foreclosure notice	1
and buying my own home. I do n't understand how it is legal for experian to put incorrect information on someone 's credit report and on top of that refuse to fix the situation! And something as big as a home loan should be taken extremely seriously when it 's placed on the wrong person credit	1
and by declining him the modification they are putting him in jeopardy of falling behind again and potentially losing his home.	1
and by listening to this message you are confirming of this valid debt	1
and by mail. I was told by the customer service rep that I could not pay by phone until the system was set up. It looks like I am suppose to pay by mail as my only option. I do not have any confidence that they will correctly process my mail payment. So I guess I need to use certified mail which adds expense that exceeds the amount of money that I was suppose to save using their loan. I can not express to you how strongly I feel that this is an unethical company.	1
and by the XXXX operator they tell me that the money had been withdraw-ed minutes ago. I let them know that they are wrong because my relative is n't being able to collect the money. And they start a case and say that they will need two weeks to investigate. After two weeks I called Money Gram Payment Systems and no one knew anything regarding the case	1
and ca n't afford to pay	1
and call me XXXX times per day	1
and call repeatedly from various numbers after I have blocked previous numbers.	1
and called Ocwen and nothing. I also called XXXX at ( XXXX ) XXXX and address at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and called PNC. Their customer service representative they were still not in receipt of the document. He also indicated that in order to ensure that these documents were received I should instead submit via an online portal. If PNC is not going to accept faxed proof of insurance they should not provide it as an option to submit documentation.	1
and called immediately	1
and called their contact number on their account.	1
and came up with the balance of {$93000.00}.	1
and can be occupied by a family member ( I am daughter ) that does n't pay rent. So this rep was blatantly denying this loan in order to steal the equity out of the house	1
and can not afford a XXXX fee. Is n't the new company supposed to honor the same terms as the old?	1
and capital one will not except payment from us and now the dealership says capital one is trying to reverse the charge and we will have legal issues if that happens how can they get away with that they were made aware of and approved the purchase but then all the sudden	1
and car payment. Furthermore	1
and cause me to be denied housing	1
and caused my credit applications to be disapproved. Please help me correct this problem ; I have already filed grievances to the credit bureaus unsuccessfully twice.	1
and causing a negative reporting issue on my credit report and transferring my account to a third party collection agency. I spoke with XXXX	1
and causing my credit score to drop a substantial amount. I believe that going into a bank and talking with a banker to close accounts should be the most foolproof way to properly close accounts. This is not the case with Wells Fargo. In addition to not closing properly	1
and causing stress to my already stressful life. I called this morning and I spoke with a rep. by the name of XXXX	1
and cell phone number ( my XXXX wireless number ).	1
and certainly never authorized Chase to charge my escrow account for it. I contacted Chase customer service at XXXX and they spoke to their insurance department at XXXX XXXX. They agreed I did not need the insurance and said they would remove. They provided confirmation # XXXX and said I would receive written confirmation in the mail. I never received and then received an escrow analysis that my monthly payment would be increasing on XX/XX/XXXX to cover the XXXX insurance. I contacted Chase again on XXXX and they said it was still pending	1
and certifiy mailed Nationstar for XXXX-years about the FHA ShortRefinance program and Nationstar will not put in writing whether or not myNationstar supports this program. My lender is XXXX XXXX Bank	1
and charge for check orders. This 3rd party is called XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and charged me a fee of XXXX {$.00}	1
and charges by Quicken Loans were {$8300.00} which my new loan balance was {$85.00}	1
and charges it to their VISA card	1
and charging me higher and higher interest with penalties has put me in this situation.	1
and church. I can not afford to loose this house and we love to continue living in this house. It has become our sacred home. Currently	1
and claiming they did not receive them. But they also claimed no correspondence received	1
and clicked a green [ Apply ] button. After scrolling through some disclosures	1
and clients that were not paying for their services. I was contacted by the servicing company that has my loan	1
and closed all accounts properly at the time and have not received any bills from XXXX ever since closing my account with them.	1
and closed all accounts with XXXX	1
and closed my old account as of XX/XX/XXXX ). I am okay with all of that ( for my protection ). However	1
and closed my old card and sent me a new card. Although I never got any verbal communication on what happened	1
and closed off my savings as my overdraft account	1
and closed. I still have n't figured out if it 's intentional	1
and collection accounts. I waited the time frame they are allowed by law they elected to remove some items from the credit report such as collections who did not respond in their time frame and that is really all. I asked about the collections that remained and was told they remained because they were validated by the source	1
and combined that with my police report	1
and companies should have to pay for violating consumers rights!!!	1
and complaints through the CFPB	1
and complaints with third parties	1
and complete evidences of ownership of debt collection right	2
and completed an Identity Fraud packet for XXXX. The debt was settled with XXXX group. They were very helpful. Now	1
and confirmation from XXXX that funds had been sent	1
and confirmed that a confirmation would be mailed to my mailing address.	1
and confirmed they are receiving payments from the XXXX company and their proposal has been accepted on my account. In XX/XX/XXXX	1
and considering this account was closed over 10 years ago	1
and consulted Wells Fargo to see if I could sell it. They told me I could not sell the house unless I paid it off and got a new mortgage	1
and consumers are forced to go through hoops and jeopardize our personally identifiable information to correct errors of the credit reporting agency.	1
and contacted them in writing. Discover Bank has refused to credit the bonus to my account. I have fulfilled the terms of our agreement and am asking that this bonus be posted to my checking account.	1
and contacted them on XXXX other occasions to collect the debt. My relative confirmed that I had resided with her	1
and continue to deny to me in an unethically and likely illegal fashion reimbursement of these funds.	1
and continueously misinformed about the process needed to save myhome. I have hired a consultant to help me thru this process and theyhave received the same treatment	1
and continues to harass us	1
and continues to have	1
and continues to put CO ( charge off ) on my credit report every month. I got advise from an attorney and the law firm I used said that Santander did nothing wrong. I contacted the Attorney General in Texas and I was informed that they would not speak to him because he was n't on my account. To this day Santander Consumer USA continues to damage my credit.	1
and continuously harassing me including hiring a Fake Law Firm and Lawyer XXXX XXXX of "" XXXX '' and a XXXX collection agency "" XXXX '' to collect this alleged debt.	1
and copies of checks for XXXX and statements from XXXX website. Instead of correcting or deleting items that obviously are being misrepresented they sent me a report file stating "" Unfortunately	1

and counted on this large purchase to be payed off from my linked personal credit card so I obtained the miles and other advantages. I asked to be allowed to pay this debt to PayPal using my credit card but this was refused by the technician and his supervisor because	1
and court fees. The total amount being sued is almost double the amount owed.	2
and create a new one. I did so	1
and created a deficit in my escrow. When my insurance company sent me a rebate	1
and creates an account summary favorable to foreclosurefor their purposes of acquisition and sale without current homeowner being made aware of this "" Predatory Lending tactic ''. My home has no court order allowing XXXX XXXX XXXX any Foreclosure status in their sale of note to Rushmore Loan Management. Now all payments made to them by me are in a default status of mortgage loan payments I have been making since XX/XX/XXXX. This deceptive Predatory lending tactic should be exposed within the Mortgage lending community as a whole	1
and credit accounts. I tried to contact some banking representatives but they explained that my accounts was closed for "" business decision '' and they ca n't give any further information. I just need to know what I did wrong so that I can avoid in future banking	1
and credit card accounts. I was a college student and my tuition status changed from out-of-state to in-state and so the amount of my financial aid checks significantly increased. At this time	1
and credit card are all declined that I do not want fill out for XXXX time it will be declined again that I am escalated afraid of declined	1
and credit cards ). There was no any explanation for doing that. Just : "" after reviewing we determined to close ''.	1
and credit reporting against me. He has also after speaking with me today	1
and cursed at. When I attempted to go online to activate card it stated that the card number was not valid. It was never stated that there would be a block placed on the card before I even received it. I feel as though they are trying to cheat me out of my tax refund. I was told XXXX different stories by customer service and if I passed all the identity verification then why I am still being denied access to my funds? I was told that the block could be released today if I passed the identity verification. Then I was told 3-5 days. This is ridiculous!	1
and customer service would say they would correct it. This never happened and so the loan kept showing in arrrears. Even though I have never missed a payment	1
and customers should know this	1
and date of birth. They told me to call the original creditor which I did as soon as I hung up with them	3
and date of charges posted ; XXXX. Copies of all documents and financial instruments used to pay the disputed late payments ; 4. Copies of all charge slips	1
and deal with whatever circumstances at a later date	1
and death threats from Wells Fargo Bank debt collectors for a debt and checking account that do not belong to me. I have never applied or opened a checking account with Wells Fargo Bank. The checking account was opened in my name illegally and fraudulently	1
and deceptive on XXXX XXXX 's part. I should have never had the judgment placed against me for {$980.00} plus fees because I did n't know anything about XXXX	1
and decided to take the funds from my account.	1
and decided to transfer the XXXX representative and I to the claims department of BOA.	1
and deciding to review my credit this account was sent to collections	1
and demanded that they remove their tradeline from my credit files. I have not received any other communication from them since. Portfolio Recovery Associates also failed to mark their tradeline as disputed on reports	1
and demanding payment for XX/XX/XXXX also. I was not late in any payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX but they refused to accept my checks! I could not pay Seterus	1
and denied ever telling us that we shared accounting number and USAA membership number. USAA responded that the unauthorized transactions did not occur because of their error and that the Automated Clearing House ( ACH ) transactions were originated by an external bank listing the correct USAA routing number and a valid USAA account number. It was XXXX XXXX of the Fraud Department	1
and did n't confirm the lower mortgage payment. I then received this Annual Escrow Disclosure Statement. Now	1
and did not have any problems with the company in that aspect of this issue.	1
and did not have my permission to set up an account in my name.	1
and did not hear anything back until today ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) when I received several calls related to this debt. It would appear that PennCredit chose to ignore the dispute of the debt and is still attempting to collect on it	1
and did not notify me. When my XXXX bill arrived	1
and different from the records Astoria Bank provided to me via my request in response to their claim	1
and disbursement ledger it shows with out our signatures and also it reflects that the sum of {$51000.00} as paid to us from the closings preceeds. We have not recollection of ever receiving or negotiating a check in this amount from Fidelity National	1
and dishonest. The owner XXXX XXXX	1
and disputed the response. The terms of the Modification program state no payment is to be made until XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
and disputed with XXXX	1
and do not expect a reply to this either. I sat on hold for many minutes today hoping to speak to someone	1
and do not know where this balance came from. I was also under the impression federal law required the collection company to verify the debt with me when I requested it in writing	1
and do not want these calls to continue.	1
and do right be ocwen by working something out that she can afford. This type of treatment is totally unethical and I demand attention to this. We may not have letters of administration from the surrogates court for 2-6 months! how can we just let the home go into foreclosure if ocwen wont speak to us in the meantime?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!!?!?!?!!?!?!?!	1

and documents to grant a loan modification on XXXX my properties. I have satsifed all requests. Also	1
and does n't state how overages are applied	1
and does not help us regain solvency as promised by SLS. We now have a mortgage of {$300000.00} and a property valued at {$200000.00}. This is hardly helpful and is little more than a sand pit that never gets emptied because the interest ( sand ) keeps filling the void. I am XXXX and do not have any earned income.	1
and domestic relations court entries. I also provided them with a form	1
and drawn my account further in overdraft.	1
and due to the mortgage company taking unril XX/XX/2015 to approve the short sale offer of XXXX	1
and during the middle of the supervisor 's review	1
and each month	1
and each month since XXXX 2013 we have pad all amounts we have charged in full. All we are asking is to pay what we owe and nothing more.	1
and each of the debt collectors by phone and in writing. They continue to harass and lie about the charges.	1
and each time I have been told it has been resolved ( ie	1
and efforts to get any questions answered via phone is impossible as customer service representatives are unable to answer questions or direct us to someone who could answer the questions. Caliber recently offered us a loan modification agreement which resulted in the {$2300.00} per month payment which included an interest only payment of {$200.00} which we understand and {$690.00} which is an ancillary payment over a XXXX month period to cover taxes paid on our behalf. We understand this as well. Then	1

and entered me into a cardholder agreement with Citibank ( while sharing my PII with them in the process ) without my explicit permission. From the cardholder agreement : "" To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities	1

and escrow companies only to be declined. Where is the protection to the consumer - I see none! Ruin your credit then we will consider helping you is not a motto anyone should be proud of. Our industry of which I have been in for 30 years is a disgrace and see no where that any of the laws and regulations and changes have helped rather make things much more atrocious. I have a XXXX and XXXX both with Citi Mortgage and the XXXX is owned by XXXX XXXX. Very disappointing that as a community of mortgage professionals we refuse to help people until they damage their credit. In the midst of all this I get a letter every month telling me my payment is past due but I seem to be able to make it by the end of month. I truly have a stack of XXXX letters from Citi Mortgage spanning over XXXX inches thick.	1

and especially when they wo n't actually tell me anything.	1
and even 4.490 %. The banks are making way too much money on these student loans and make no attempt to lower these interest rates. I understand banks having to make money	1
and even denied the transactions taking place. I even offered to send them a screenshot of my bank statement. XXXX told me that he would have his manager call me back. This is completely fraud and I do not understand why they would try to get over on young people in the military.	1
and even elderly grandparents to ask for contact information ( which they currently have ). In each instance	1
and even harder to handle my other household responsibilities.the interest is extremely high as well	1
and even has my co-workers relaying messages to me in order to call her back.. She has also been telling my co-workers that I do n't answer my phone or reply to voice messages which makes me look bad to my employer and puts my job in GREAT jeopardy. One of the numbers she has been calling from is XXXX. IT NEEDS TO STOP!	1
and even have an email proving that I updated my new mailing address within 30 days after moving. According to Florida statute XXXX	1
and even if I broke my lease the amount would not be that high still! I was never contacted until a few months ago from a place called Rent Recover LLC. I do not owe this money. I did not owe that much money when I left. When I called the office at XXXX point to inquire if this would affect me getting another apartment they said I only owed about {$1000.00}. I filed with the XXXX	1
and even offered to file the claim myself. I have yet to receive a bill or an itemized statement from XXXX or ARM explaining the charges. It is my understanding that XXXX filed bankruptcy	1
and even though they acknowledge they still have a surplus of {$1900.00} which I am due	1
and even to the Driver of the other car. Telling them what had happened and what I have done and where I was at now living in XXXX. I sent them letters from XXXX along with my Mom printed out a letter and mailed it from XXXX. Along with this while I was still willing to work with them I was in dispute of the total amount owed. When I got the first bill for her repairs in was XXXX somthing dollars. Then after I got the letter from XXXX XXXX saying I was 100 % liable I then got another letter saying that the new total was jumped to over XXXX dollars. Based on this	1
and eventually threats of foreclosure (! ). Simultaneously I am attempting to go through the 'proper channels '. I contact the mortgage company telephonically	1
and every day I was asking was there any paperwork missing? are we good to go? And the answer I was always getting was they are still reviewing my short sale	1
and everywhere I go I am told that I am unable to open a new account of any kind due to a BANK OF AMERICA account that was satisfied. When I went to BOA to enquire about this	1
and explained that there is only XXXX months of forbearance available. She took my {$50.00} "" good faith '' payment and told me the next payment would be due in XXXX	1
and extended our loan to a 40 year mortgage. So now we find ourselves paying about the same payments that we were before only now much less of that money goes towards the principal. When you are facing loosing you 'd home	1
and failed to fill out the certification that the individual was physically present at the property. Quicken Loans failed to contact me to get the matter resolved. I as an individual had to gather documents from XXXX	1
and fake docket number. I later called back to get their address and they refused to give me their address. I have not received anything by mail informing me of this debt	2
and faulty equipment	1
and fax it to Ocwen. He stated this had to be done in order for Ocwen to start accepting payments. After much back and forth between my attorney and Ocwen I learned that the information your CSR gave me was incorrect and that I should have been able to make a payment. Due to this I fell behind on my mortgage and then unfortunately lost my job early XXXX of this year. By the time I had all the information from my attorney and Ocwen	1
and fax those documents to Synchrony as well as a letter stating that I wanted them to take certain actions	1
and fee schedule sheets to prove that. I have faxed these records to Capio and they have refused to acknowledge receipt of them : putting me on hold	1

The claim was quickly processed by XXXX XXXX and we received a check for the damages in the amount of approximately {$12000.00} ( depreciated value ) of a total claim of XXXX. We were required to have Pinnacle Mortgage endorse the check. We contacted Pinnacle for instructions on how to obtain their endorsement and proceed with ordering/paying for repairs. We were instructed in writing that we would need to endorse the check over to Pinnacle and submit proof of 100 % completion of repairs to receive distribution of funds. We called to inquire as we could not complete or start repairs without funds from the claim. We were told that even though the written requirements indicate a need for a certificate of completion	1
and fictitious. Not only do they not provide details	1
and filed a claim through their process which they then denied. I have a copy of the online chat with their representatives and a screen capture of the charges applied to my account. I do not understand how this is not flat out stealing.	1
and filed a demand on US Court. After two years in court the judge decided the case was dismissed with prejudice on our favor.	1
and filed a judgement against us and 100	1
and finally XXXX was paid XX/XX/XXXX. Then XXXXI received a bill with a due date of XXXX XXXX that included a late feefee for XX/XX/XXXX of {$25.00}. As you can see	1
and finally a supervisor took the time to figure it out. Never was a detailed bill sent until well after the issue was determined.	1
and finally called to cancel my card ( tore it up ). I thought that was the end of it. Since my call	1
and finally for not promptly and simply taking action to remove the erroneous information from their tracking systems without undue burden on me.	1
and finally on XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
and finally was able to get a case manager. I supposedly entered into a lower interest rate payment plan	1
and finally was able to leave the scary	2

and financial problems related to an ongoing business. The bank entered into foreclosure action in XX/XX/XXXX	1
and financially	1
and for Equifax to be penalized for allowing this to repeatedly occur on my credit report. For example	1
and for each failure to respond to the issue brought to them and clearly spelled out and not acted on	1
and for the first time	1
and for them to send the agreed upon arrangement in writing so that we have a record of what we agreed to. We have not received that. Today my wife again emailed and asked for this	1
and formerly my homestead	1
and forward the documents to the Creditors	1
and found a negative nonpayment and delinquent report.	1
and found many complaints that they are a scam agency	1
and found that Wells Fargo made an error on the Truth in Lending statement in regards to our taxes. We contacted Wells Fargo in an attempt to resolve this situation. After 2 months of review	1
and fraud says that unless its fraud they can not do anything but cancel the card. I do not wish to cancel the card since its linked to other bills and I would still have the erroneous charge. Just today I got a letter in the mail from chase stating that they routinely monitor account activity to minimize fraud and have been unable to contact me to verify a recent transaction ; yet this is after I have spent over XXXX hours on the phone trying to rectify this matter. Then when I go to email them about the dispute	1
and fraudulent. Attached you will find the documents showing the payment differences the wire transfer and the over payment to them supporting my claims.	1
and frequent follow-up	1
and friend	1
and frustrated. We also had problems with our paperwork that added to the frustration of the boarding process. I was asked to give them a credit card for on board purchases	1
and further more earlier this year XXXX ( XXXX collages ) was sued and forced to pay back the loans for the students who still had loans out but it dont cover private loans so now again you me expect to pay you back the money i borrowed under the schools advice which they adivse all their students to get XXXX and perkins so they are your biggest asset and now you have lost that asset due to thier own negligence to the students the people who are the reason you get a paycheck and if you dont take of this matter ill personally make sure no student in the future will ever use XXXX again so as to put you out of business but use of the internet and put you of work cause you are too GREEDY to help those who have wronged and lied to by their respective schools.	1
and further recorded erroneous late payments on my EQUIFAX	1
and gave in to giving them my address. They told me that I owed them money from a previous doctors bill. I asked them to verify the information they were talking about. They could n't. They just told me that I owed them money from a doctors office. I told them they needed to send me information on this	1
and gave me a new payoff amount. I had to pay interest for the difference	1
and gave me a toll free number to call. I spoke to XXXX different 'supervisors ' when I called. Neither could give me any information regarding my account	1
and gave me his number. I called numerous times until he finally returned my phone call. I thought this would speed the process up to keep up the communication	1
and get you to sell their products in that state. After i realized XXXX didnt have the cleanest sales	1
and given empty promises that the money would be deposited into my account. The XXXX time the money was supposed to be deposited	1
and given the complete run-around when I ask direct questions. I was told by someone there	1
and gives it to his mother who gives it to me. The statement in the envelope says : Urgent Notice : Please contact your mortgage servicer immediately at : XXXX Thank You "" XXXX MOVE ''	1
and got a payment due of about {$170.00}. If I had not gone over	1
and got loan through FEMA for {$51000.00} for repairs. We were then required to get flood insurance to receive this loan. For the next 4 years there were no problems. So we now believed this was indeed a freak thing	1
and government issued and I paid for documents. Trans Union needs to stop this holding my own private personal information in error by malice and cease w/ all reporting of fraudulent data that they know the other Credit agencies are not. Trans Union has been doing this to me for over 16yrs now always demanding my personal ID and SSA card which I have the right to refuse	1
and granted my checks be garnished. The 3rd party was Served at an address I 've Never resided. The person that received the complaint ( XXXX XXXX ) also refused to sign off on the return of service.	1
and had XXXX of the fees removed but was then informed there were XXXX more being added for a total of XXXX. The customer care rep informed me she could only do a courtesy credit of XXXX fee per year. We have tried to negotiate these fees with the branch manager since then	1
and had XXXX options to pay the bills off. 1. By paying {$640.00}	1
and had a payback date of XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX my Husband made an on line payment to my account of {$170.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX a payment of {$170.00} was made from our checking account	1
and had brought my available balance into the negative. Seeing this	1
and had closed my bank account and opened a new XXXX ) ; it was	1
and had leased credit card terminal equipment from FDGL.. During this time	1
and had no need to withdraw money from her savings account. She has been in ill health over the past several years and is rarely out if the house. She did NOT make this withdrawal.	1
and had no right to call any 3rd party to question them.	1
and had received an initial encouraging response on one of the properties. XXXX XXXX called us at XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX	1
and had sold the tax lien to an investor	1
and had to explain that an investigation was already underway. From what the representative told me on the phone	1
and handled the business aspects of the property	1
and hang up the phone when I say they are harassing me.	1
and harass and repeatedly call and threaten people	1
and harass me at work after I told him I will get in trouble for the phone calls	1
and harass me. I have tried to talk to them but they refused to listen.	1
and has a XXXX year old daughter. I am under tremendous stress	1
and has been attempting diligently to release his interest to the secured property with either a deed in lieu of foreclosure or a short sale.	1
and has been taking advantage of the low income population. XXXX and I have been paying a 17 % interest rate on a XXXX loan. And from the document I see they are charging {$7.00} dollars of interest a day. I do not think this is a normal tactic. I 've reached out to Firstbank countless time for help and they refuse to help me. I have thought about the different ways to get myself out of my situation	1
and has called multiple times after XXXX. XXXX times they will call and nobody will be there when I answer	1
and has cost us XXXX of dollars in fees as a result. When we asked XXXX XXXX -- the man responsible for this mistake -- to rectify it by rushing the package	1
and has even verbally attacked me on the phone. I even had to change my phone number and they STILL keep calling.	2
and has never lived at my address. I requested Northland Group take my phone number off their call list and they said they would. I asked which company was collecting the debt so I could talk directly to them and they refused to tell me. I saw on my caller ID that Northland Group called again on XXXX XXXX	1
and has no documentation regarding the sale of the home '' Wells Fargo 's underwriters failed to comply with HUD property requirements. The City of XXXX XXXX terminated the employment of Public Works Director	1
and has no first-hand information whatsoever regarding any such filing. Yet	1
and has not remitted payment to my County 's tax department. This is the XXXX occasion in which my Mortgage Servicer has not responded in a timely fashion to a request for escrow servicing.	1
and has prevented me from being able to obtain a competitive home loan. With this recent 30 day late on my credit file	1
and has remained current for the entire duration of its term. After checking their records	1
and has requested a reduction in the wage garnishment. However	1
and has violated innumerable laws. The complaint originated because Chase has not been recognizing deposits or transfers from other banks in a timely manner	1
and have XXXX other loans with them	1
and have been accruing interest since XXXX 2014.	1
and have been harmed as I have been paying monthly for the service that does not do what they say they will do. The disputes I have submitted	1
and have been less than forthcoming in the letter that they sent to us after we got our Congressman involved regarding why this has happened. We are not asking for anything for free	1
and have been mislead by the school to take out private and federal loans.	1
and have been paying as agreed. XXXX companies have refused to report my payments on my credit report. My report states-account closed due to chapter XXXX. This is hurting my credit score tremendously.	1
and have been since XXXX XXXX. Up until that time I paid the loan and was current and up to date. I now have received 2 collection notices from Windham Professionals stating that I owe the XXXX these loans	1
and have been with another company for seventeen years. The account number on the bill	1
and have called springboard back to help me get thru. We were cut off and now they have not returned any of my phone calls. NO ONE is responding over weeks of frustration ignored messages and plain ol just letting me drown out here. Just to add ... XXXX forced me to sell my home of XXXX when I became XXXX ... .this was in XX/XX/XXXX during the crash. Because of the crash I lost XXXX of dollars on my home and most of my equity ... but I finally sold and moved here. It was bank owned and I was not informed of the many many MANY repairs that drained my savings account. I had not been notified of a special assessment on my Home owners association dues so they were XXXX dollars a month higher and I had health issues which cased great strain on my budget.	1
and have called us to collect payments earlier than scheduled to get a double payment for that month	1
and have changed the account numbers. I AM OUTRAGED AT THIS!	1
and have completely failed to notify me of any changes whether by email or by paper mail or by phone. As a result the unauthorized fees caused my account balance to go down without my knowledge	1
and have crucially impeded any/all of my attempts at a "" responsible '' resolution.	1
and have even reached out to my brother. The calls are repetitive	1
and have even used XXXX separate "" relationship managers. '' Around XX/XX/XXXX	1
and have for months refused to issue the appropriate refund. Due to Caliber 's error I have lost accrued interest and now my escrow amount due was recently increased to my detriment and through no fault of my own. See this e-mail thread for a summary of the problem : Thanks	1
and have had to resubmit all short sale documents numerous times	1
and have left 3 messages for him to discuss taking off that late payment due to escrow discrepancy and going forward with my PMI removal. my first phone call regarding this matter was XXXX XXXX	1
and have maintained account in good standing. I 'm not getting any assistance from the bank for this issue.	1
and have n't received any paper work since then.We really need this issue resolved and removed from our credit.	1
and have never had to make a late payment fee for any cards prior to this past year. This recent problem with late payments on credit cards bills has not occurred with any other credit cards. XXXX of the cards are those issued by Synchrony Bank	1
and have never payed more than 30 days late.	1
and have not bothered to report again in over six years. It is now passed the statutory limit for collection and I want it completely removed from my credit report.	1
and have paid or am in the process of paying the debts that I owe. I have never XXXX dealt with a company called XXXX Solutions	1
and have reaquested that they change the autopay option I have set up with XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and have said that they will turn report this to the credit agencies. In the meantime because I am unable to make the full payment they are tacking on late fees.	1
and have the funds transferred to an account	1
and have the manager place a call directly to the lien release department for BoA.	1
and have the only interest in this mortgage. I advised XXXX	1
and have the usual convoluted call director that ends up on a "" forever '' hold. They do n't accept online payments. It is my suspicion they are trying to set up some additional fees by charging for late payments. We had a similar problem prior to our HARP II refinance with XXXX Mortgage.	1
and have to have a bad credit reporting for 30 years. How is that when the statue of limitation on debt is 7 years. A foreclosure does n't stay on for 30 years so	1
and have told the same to XXXX different family members.	1
and have tried to assess late fees. It is now up to me to produce a copy of the deposited check for them to review. They have been anything but helpful unless it involves them sending me late notices and collection notices.	1
and have used the same tactics of "" missing documents '' to stall the process indefinitely. XXXX forced us to sign documents to do a "" temporary modification '' without telling us that they were extending the term to 40 years	1
and having all the evidence showing this is unfair	3
and having discussions with	1
and he also showed them an income tax return with his Social Security Number	1
and he assured me that the payment would be honored towards the "" re-age. '' But it was not. Shortly thereafter I received a debt collection notice. I called and was told it was too late to re-age but they would wave the late fees if I could catch up with XXXX payments by XXXX XXXX. It was difficult but I managed to make the payments	1
and he immediately sent a no trespassing order	1
and he informed the branch in XXXX where we usually do business and they were helpful. My husband does n't do much banking	1
and he made sure I had the receive code to send the first payments through verified funds. When I was having trouble sending the payments	1
and he never calls back	1
and he never returned. In XX/XX/XXXX I sent AA a certified letter XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX requesting they validate the debt	1
and he never returned. In XX/XX/XXXX I sent XXXX a certified letter ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) requesting they validate the debt	1
and he put in writing that I was due the principle and interest refund. He also said escrows from the closed loan would be refunded in 2-3 wks. On XXXX XXXX	1
and he refused to answer yes or no.	1
and he refused. XXXX also stated that Wells Fargo would not be sending me any written correspondence stating that we were denied for any type of assistance.	1
and he said he would try to expedite my refund	1
and he said that I agreed to that by having my mortgage with Carrington. I told him that he had to abide by my original loan terms	1
and he said the check had cleared his account on XXXX XXXX. I talked to customer service	1
and he stated citi ca n't close my account unless I cooperate with him to answer all the questions he asked and in the exact format he needed including some personal questions about my business. When I said I was not comfortable sharing that info and hoped he could record my answer to that question as "" N/A '' and then move on to help close my account	1
and he stated that the "" XXXX XXXX '' does not take settlements. I said	1
and he stated that until I faxed him that VA statement	1
and he told me I have to dispute it in writing.I sent out a LETTER ON XX/XX/XXXX	1
and he told me I should be able to qualify without problem after he reviewed all my documentation. I made {$110000.00} yearly	1
and he told me the case is closed	1
and he transfereed me to a loan officer right away	1
and he wanted me to go there and get it. XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and he wanted us to apply for a new loan	1
and he went inside my home on XXXX XXXX	1
and he would TRY to get the ball rolling on that. So 65 days later and 2 weeks away from 90 days behind on loan and foreclosure I 'm no further now than what i was on day 1. I feel that they are dragging this out till it 's too late for them t help me. I have XXXX XXXX children and this is the only home they 've ever know	1
and he would like to retire on XXXX XXXX XXXX. We have told them that there will be a income reduction when that happens so we need a modification that will take that into consideration also.	1
and health situation. I did not see any notice indicating I was being turned over to collections. and this was going on my report.	1
and heartache	1
and help that was supposed to be made available to me - programs coming from the federal government	1
and hence	1
and hence confirmed that the charge was fraudulent.	1
and her address is now listed on my credit report. I have never held residence at the addresses on XXXX XXXX. Neither companies are helping me resolve this error.	1
and here it is XX/XX/XXXX	1
and here it is XX/XX/XXXX and he still owe {$32000.00}	1
and high late fees	1
and his employer Flagstar Bank.	1
and his lack of professional standards contribute to additional erosion in confidence that Texas residents rely upon from the industry he represents.	1
and his name is nowhere near mine. They immediately removed it off of my account	1
and his valuation of {$500000.00} is at least {$50000.00} lower than comparable market values we received. As a result of the low valuation	1
and home equity line of credit into XXXX conventional home mortgage loan with a reasonable interest rate	1
and home owner insurance	1
and how I must feel being unfairly punished by this misreporting	1
and how can they now file a case against the fraud and help me getting refund. Please help!! XXXX of my friends paid this fraud person as well in different bank account	1
and how payments were applied ; 5. Copy of all disclosures and rate sheets ; 6. Complete history of escrow analysis ; 7. Copy of truth-In-Lending statements and disclosures ; XXXX. Loan servicing agreement XXXX s ) with the loan originator ; 9. All letters	1
and how to complain to the FTC about it!	1
and how. I have health insurance through my employer and auto insurance through a Company in the mid-west. I 'm going to file a complaint with the Department of Insurance as well.	1
and humiliate the borrower. They obviously have never sat in on a single class to learn about the parameters set forth by the fed on debt collecting. When we were unable to make the payments due to the loss of employment Vanderbilt associates made endless harassing phone calls. They called my family members telling them "" they were unable to reach me and were very concerned since we had fallen behind on our payments. '' This information is private. I was in constant contact with them updating them on our situation	1
and hung up on	1
and hung up. I called back and spoke to some else to complain	1
and i believe this is a bait and switch technique	1
and i did n't get the collection notices too. Now i need to pay {$1500.00} after all those late fee and interest charges in order to remove the collection from my credit report because they were confused and forgot the notify me that they did n't release the fund to merchant and or me. and accusing me it is my fault originally because i filed dispute. i am so frustrated why it is my fault. they probably kept the money forever if i did n't find out. i do n't understand how can bank make this kind of mistake. its not XXXX cents. it is over XXXX dollars. they need to take the response and take care of this matter.	1
and i told him that i wo n't pay the amount until i get the result of the investigation he put me on hold for awhile and after awhile he said that he ca n't access my account because it is closed already	1
and i want a full refund for that fee!	1
and if First Hawaiian Bank checks their records they 'll find that previous to this transaction my account had been over drafted several times before. At the time I deposited that fraudulent check	1
and if I did	1
and if I do n't check that box	1
and if I opened an account	1
and if I want to contest it	1
and if Navient were to allow ( promote! ) this. I am XXXX years old	1
and if all went well	1
and if any of my loans can be forgiven. I would deeply applicate any help because I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I was XXXX	1
and if i try to call AMEX they just say it has gone to collections and refuse to talk to me. None of the collectors ever send a copy of what I am being charged for.	1
and if it did then I do n't want to proceed with them. They made it very clear that this will only be a soft check and it will in no way affect my credit history/report. I went ahead with the pre-qualification with them based on this assurance. However to my surprise my credit history was affected as they run a hard check on my SSN. When I contacted them asking for explanation	2
and if it was n't paid in full	1
and if l have a XXXX to draw from to pay the debt? He went on to threaten me that	1
and if the payment has n't posted	1
and if they are applying my payments to my account?	1
and if they were not willing to do this	1
and if verification can not be made within 30 days time frame allowed to Experian by law. the disputes listed in my original complaint must now be completely removed from my credit report ( Experian has now legally exceeded the time frame allowed by law ).	1
and if you put the balance back into the loan. Why do I have to pay it over again. It appears that I 'm paying the you and taxes and insurance over again. I just want a final balance amount of what I owe so that every year there is n't an increase unless Taxes and insurance increase. I do n't have a problem with the increase in taxes and insurance ... that I understand.	1
and illegal tactics to collecting an overly inflated alleged debt out of retaliation violating the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practice Act	1
and illegally trying to do so.	1
and improper crediting of payments under federal modification agreements.	1
and in 8 years I have n't reduced the loan amount at all.	1
and in XX/XX/XXXX	1
and in a way that the interest payments were adjusted back to reflect this payment in XXXX	1
and in discussing the situation	1
and in fact I was given a confirmation number as receipt of payment. A week later I checked my bank account and no funds had been taken out of my account. XXXX 's website now said that my loan had been sold and gave me an incorrect customer service number for Loancare XXXX. After finding the correct number ( and calling XXXX to let them know the number on both their website and customer service line was incorrect	1
and in fact is paid by auto pay through my credit card. I only heard of this three year old balance from delivery of a collection letter. I believe XXXX is making up this charge from something they acknowledge occurred three years ago ( XXXX 2013 ). In my call to them	1
and in fact it has been. I was then informed by a supervisor that Capital One does not grant goodwill removal of late payments	1
and in fact were not enough to cover the actual interest in each payment period. The total interest payments in 2015 totaled {$11000.00}. XXXX reported to the IRS that my interest payments in 2015 were only {$8100.00}. This is the figure that was supplied on the IRS form XXXX. There has never been an explanation as to what happened to the {$3100.00} difference. I believe XXXX is violating Mortgage Servicing Rules by either under-reporting interest paid in a year or failing to report on the reason for the difference between interest paid by the homeowner ( myself ) and interest reported to the IRS.	1
and in failing to do so and leaving threatening messages for unintended parties with small children in the home they demonstrated highly irresponsible behavior. I have saved the message and will gladly replay it for any investigators interested in pursuing this further.	1
and in good faith we made an extra payment. I then provided them documentation proving the XXXX	1
and in no way acknowledged or authorized the conversion. XXXX monthly fees have been charged to my account	1
and in only one day	2
and in putting that unauthorized charge through	1
and in some cases outright misleading.	1
and in spite of the already agreed to Trial Period Plan for our mortgage modification. Nothing about settling our account that quickly after the first three payments came up during my conversation with lender	1
and in the past 4 months	1
and in violation of RESPA. We are asking the CFPB to contact the servicer	1
and included copies of negotiated checks that Ocwen had accepted for payment .At this point the modification had carried on for over a year. I then was assigned a date to meet with attorneys for Ocwen as well as a foreclosure mediator	1
and inconsiderate.	1
and incorrectly included our sanitation/solid waste fee in the analysis. The analysis also included a revised payment amount effective XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( which increased payment has been paid ). I contacted the servicer on XXXX XXXX to let them know the solid waste fee was improperly included	1
and increased my credit limit. Here I am again	1
and infact in those months of XXXX they pingged my XXXX work report and knew where i was	2
and infact in those months of XXXX they pingged my equifax work report and knew where i was	1
and inform them I am pushing for BOA to be fined. I can produce the statements and paymentdetails as needed.	1
and informed me that I had a 60 day grace period to pay my mortgage. Today less than 30 days later I received a letter from first mortage stating that I was 30 days late on my mortgage	1
and informed them that XXXX was handling the matter. In one call	1
and informed them that the debt collector invoiced me for a original creditor that does not exist	1
and insisted on discussing it with only my insurance agent. The matter was never corrected. U.S. Bank refused to accept the loss due to their negligence and have withheld the money paid out in error from the loan pay off on XXXX XXXX	1
and insists it will take months to figure out what has happened and effect the refund. Obviously we are into the third month already. XXXX 's helplessness and puzzlement is incredulous. With a few keystrokes they can most likely locate and immediately effect a refund.	1
and instead decided to make monthly electronic debits of $ XXXX dollars according to the terms of the original contract. I do not check my bank account regularly	1
and instead demanding cash payments to herself by title the Branch Manager US Bank now claims is "" not the Branch Manager '' in person only	1
and insulted us with a claim of confidential information of non-payment. This claim is patently false as the account the check is drawn from is my own and my credit union has already sent them the funds. I believe this claim is used as an unsubstantiated excuse.	1
and insured state branches of foreign banks.	1
and intended to leave without talking with the person.	1
and intended to work on the process of consolidation this coming week after returning home from my trip. XXXX ( a company that is related to Sallie Mae ) also called me multiple times this evening. With XXXX	1
and interest is accruing on the account.	1
and interest. They deceived us about foreclosure alternatives. They failed to provide accurate information about loan modification and other loss-mitigation services	1
and into my name. I pay the mortgage	1
and invented fees all which are causing me financial injury. I asked that the escrow account be cancelled	1
and irresponsible business practices.	1
and is causing me unnecessary XXXX. I have talked to numerous professionals in the mortgage industry who said they have never heard of such actions	1
and is currently engaging in multiple Dodd-Frank violations with my FHA loan. Refusal to accept payments has put the loan even more behind than when initial talks for modification began.	1
and is dishonest in addressing complaints. This complaint speaks to the CFPB ability to protect consumers when the bank alters the information to cover up their errors. If this kind of behavior is left unchecked no consumer will be protected. This kind of action will actually create a bank more likely to abuse consumers. A bank confident that they can act in whatever fashion that suits them because no one can create any penalty or harm.	1
and is having there payer pay the additional daily interest accumulated since the day the original should of been process. It appears that from past transactions that Chrysler Capital is not processing and checks till XXXX days prior to due date. Frauding there customers by charging more daily interest on the account. That is almost {$6.00} per day on this loan	1
and is increasing our payments.	1
and is investigating the issue ... .and we are not entitled to know anything further. WHY? If someone physically assaulted me and took me to an ATM machine and made me withdraw lots of money at gunpoint	1
and is now on total XXXX. During her time of illness	1
and is refusing to give me credit for the "" unearned / unaccrued '' portion of the interest. WellsFargo seems to be charging me equivalent of a "" pre-payment '' penalty	1
and is therefore more than 5 years	1
and is therefore void. I have contacted both DFS and XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the company contracted by DFS to issue redress checks )	1
and is trying to shake me down for money I do n't have	1
and is very detrimental. Although it is your policy to keep reporting bankruptcies that are filed	1
and is very stubborn and not very educated	1
and issues a dispute per suggestion of the credit rep and waited another 30 days for the dispute to come back with the same delinquency dates being reported. I contacted PRA again to ask why they would be reporting the same delinquency dates when my account was resolved in XX/XX/XXXX and have documentation from them on that. I questioned why they would not modify the dates on the new dispute if clearly My account had been closed since the beginning of the year. They said they are n't sure and to email the credit information to their disputes department I have that show the incorrect months being reported	1

and it 's a great inconvenience to get up from my desk and answer this call. Thank you.	1
and it 's hurting my business. They have taken an entire weeks worth of revenue	1
and it appeared that the account belongs to my father. Certainly	1
and it arrived with a {$50.00} charge already on the account before I even activated the card. Also	1
and it came back as verified. In XXXX XXXX	1
and it came back verified. I contacted the XXXX County court via certified mail and asked for the judgment to be set aside per I unaware any court date regarding this matter that the XXXX states that I did not show for	1
and it can take up to XXXX days for the refund. I said in this day of electronics	1
and it cleared and was credited on Monday	1
and it did not have an option to use a deposit slip or a deposit envelope. The deposit amount was determined via an internal scanner. There is also no envelope for depositing cash	1
and it does not matter whether the borrower entered into a HAMP or alternative modification	1
and it goes on for months	1
and it has not been resolved yet. It has been over 120 days and they are still saying it will be another XXXX. Why even have Federal Laws if the Credit Bureaus do not follow them and are not held accountable. At this point	1
and it has not happened.	1
and it is annoying. The calls start at XXXX XXXX	1
and it is no longer in my possession. As a rule of thumb	1
and it is not. I am paying this back to XXXX companies.	1
and it is presently with HBC and is being serviced by Select Portfolio Servicing Inc	1
and it keeps getting worse. Because of Discover taking so long to correct the fraud and making mistakes with putting the charge on an off of the account balance	1
and it needed to be reconsider and I also sent more comparables since the appraiser said he was not able to find recent comps for my property and he used some that had more than a year ago! Today I received a call that my petition came at the same price! They not only waste my time	1
and it printed a receipt saying "" that the ATM was having technical difficulties ''. After we stayed outside of the bank for XXXX minutes wishing that the money will come out	1
and it represented an inappropriately aggressive collections tactic ( designed	1
and it routed me to a lady who saw all my information	1
and it seems there continues to be problems with Bank of America accurately reporting information. This is the second CFPB complaint I have had to file regarding this matter. See the attached documents. Please submit a letter to me stating the fact that loan # XXXX in the original amount of {$280000.00} was closed XX/XX/XXXX. I have support showing that I was issued a cancellation of debt XX/XX/XXXX.	1
and it should not be that difficult they hung up. About a week later the same company called me this time after my relatives said they would report them. They proceeded to tell me the same song and dance	1
and it shows they are still charging me interest. How can this be when the account has been closed and charged off? I feel that they are not applying my money in an appropriate manner so that this may be paid off quicker. While I do agree that we were behind and we owe this debt	2
and it stated that they have responded to my previous disputes and there is not any new facts to form a new investigation pursuant to the fair credit reporting act U.S.C. section 1681s-2 ( a ) ( 8 ) ( F ) ( i ) ( 11 ) and no further replies will be forthcoming.	2
and it states that I need to sign the documents and send them back	1
and it still showing in my credit report as unpaid on XXXX AGENCY So my credit is lower then it should be only because of this derogatory item.	1
and it turns out XXXX closed the account and have stolen the {$1800.00}. I 've contacted XXXX customer service	1
and it was AFTER the fact. We signed the addendum	1
and it was approved by my mortgage companies. My XXXX mortgage was completely resolved with the proceeds from the sale. However	1
and it was confirmed that there were sufficient funds in the account to ascertain that the XXXX payment was cleared.	1
and it was disposed of by the judge over 3-4 years ago because XXXX 's attorneys could n't offer any proof.	2

and it will be reported and treated as such. This company also does n't verify my information before disclosing any info. They do n't say	1
and it will take another 2 weeks for the results. Culprit Loancare - Escrow	1
and it would be another XXXX days and they where XXXX it never came. XXXX days later they said they needed to have papers filled out to reissue they check. in the mean time his XXXX ssi payment was put into the closed account	1
and it would have to be put through a third time. Frustrated as it was now XX/XX/XXXX made sure they had my banking info. almost 2 weeks and no communication and no transfer	1
and it would show up in XXXX to XXXX billing cycles. I waited for approximately 6 weeks	1
and it would take three weeks to read them all. The mortgage process as defined today by the fedl government is broken and confuses me to death. Could you please abolish your existence and let smart people run this business? For god sakes	1
and just called this morning	1
and just get the Experian report. OR ( and this is what I did )	1
and just give me one month to book my reward stay in order to use the benefit before it is gone.	1
and just keep getting transferred back and forth	1
and kept me from getting a job XXXX! this is ridiculous to get something done with this company	1
and kept me from getting a job selling insurance! this is ridiculous to get something done with this bureau	1
and kept returning my payment funds. After much back and forth with the bank and store	1

and last XXXX digits of my social	1

and leave a message	1
and leave me with an outstanding principal balance they are demanding I pay to the account. I asked why it is I have to pay the remaining after being caused grief from this company	1
and leaving me uninsured and vulnerable to loss. All while collecting escrow and refusing to allow me the responsibility of paying the insurance and real estate tax myself.	1
and left a message for me on his family 's machine saying it was from a debt collector for ME giving my name. I called them back and asked how they got his number and they said it was listed as an emergency contact in my medical records. I would like to know how a medical collection agency has access to my medical records if this is in fact how they got his number. My brother is not listed on anything	1
and left me with no cash for food	1
and legally I was not responsible for paying for that. I called and explained this to the person at experian	1
and let 's face it	1
and let them know that this was now a "" paid collections '' and would be closed. To this day I have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and Diversified Consultants	1
and letters from executives that claim they work in the Wells Fargo presidential suite offering to help me obtain other alternatives to loan modification as I seek help.	1
and lied to me about not just what they said about the {$200.00} that they promissed me back after everything was completed	1
and loan officer XXXX XXXX	1
and made XXXX bill pay {$830.00} on XXXX XXXX	1
and made changes again proving they are lying about the information provided on my report.	1
and made dozens of illegal calls to me in an effort to collect payment. To end this dispute	1
and made his/her way to transfer this Credit card debt to me. The account was sold to another collection agency with very rude callers with whom was totally impossible to speak. One time I was able to get a XXXX operator who told me that this credit card debt dated from XXXX and was charged for a beauty treatment or surgery. It was a case of identity and we did n't know what else to do.	1
and made multiple attempts to dispute any personal obligation of the alleged debt and suggested that the such transactions were unauthorized and any credit granted to me was non-transferrable	1
and mailed a Cease and Desist Notice pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ) 15 USC 1692c ( c ) on XXXX XXXX 2015 warning that further contact of any kind would be considered harassment and that any unsubstantiated mark made by Southwest Credit Systems on my credit reports would be considered Defamation of Character and violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Southwest Credit Systems placed a derogatory remark on my credit reports on XXXX XXXX 2015 in reference to this unvalidated account.	1
and mailed it the next day	1
and mailed out the form on XXXX/XXXX/2015 to the address provided. However	1

and mangers that I could supposedly negotiate with constantly changing	1

My hardship began in XXXX 2013 when my husband passed. He was the major wage earner of the home. I begged my family to move in with me to help me with expenses and help me with the grief of losing my husband. There was no will or probate. I lost 85 % of the household income. ARM loan.	1
and many others	1
and marriage certificate ( that is filed with the XXXX XXXX Court House and im sure a copy can be requested by any party ) and all cards were re-issued with the new married name. The bills I was shown by the previous creditor showed bills in my maden name after that date and still said another name for a long time after my name was changed on all my accounts with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I had new cards issued in my maden name that does not match the bill	1
and may result in fees from the bank.	1
and meanwhile they cashed my check and mis-applied funds to someone else 's account. I called my bank	1
and misinformation. They accepted then rejected a flood policy sent from Nation-Wide insurance which insured the home for the value of the building. To add insult to injury	1
and misquoting Homeowner 's Protection Act laws to dissuade me from pursuing PMI cancellation.	1
and mitigation services immediately to eradicate affected materials to make our home safe. We filed an insurance claim that day XX/XX/2015. The insurance adj came to our home on XX/XX/2015 and wrote an estimate for repair costs not including the costs for services already completed. This estimate totaled {$10000.00}. The adjustor then gave us a check for {$6100.00} and had Penny Mac listed on the check. He then explained that Penny Mac requires this if the damage exceeds {$7000.00}. I then contacted Penny Mac for instructions. After receiving instructions	1
and monthly mortgage statement. At that point	1
and monthly payment amount. This monthly payment amount was periodically reduced to reflect my excess loan payments ( I assume )	1
and more importantly	1
and more recently on XX/XX/XXXX an account rep stated even the supervisor says "" hands are tied '' and there was nothing they can do	1
and most of all did serious irreparable damage to my life. They did not at any point follow any XXXX rules or send any disclosures. They lied and said I was approved when I was apparently was not. They lied and said they worked together when they did not. They ran an incredibly excessive XXXX hard inquiries all on different days. XXXX handed me off to XXXX without my consent under the pretext that they were "" co-workers '' and although XXXX had me approved XXXX had an approval that was less labor intensive. Once working with XXXX I provided him with all the required documents that were asked for and he had given my real estate agent an okay to close. 3 days before closing he sent out an email saying he could not follow through on his commitment. This is after both the seller and myself had already arranged moving	1
and most recently certified my home as vacant even though I am still living here ( I was handed the vacant cert on my front step ). Most recently the bank informed my attorney that the offer on my home was too low and they would not accept the short sale. they refused to provide a counter offer or let us know what the value of the house was ( appraisal had been done in XXXX 2015 by the bank. The foreclosure process was started in XXXX 2015	1
and most recently sent me to foreclosure stating I had not made a mortgage payment since XXXX of XXXX ( which I did - I attached my bank statements showing the wire transfers )! This all started when my husband thought I made the mortgage payment and I thought he did so we missed a month. I called Ocwen immediately and spoke to a representative who set up a payment plan where we would add XXXX to the next XXXX payments ( which is when I was told I would have to wire payments ). They wo n't allow me online access	1

and moved out. Almost XXXX yearslater	1
and must be someone going around illegally trying to collect money ) has gone with a new debt collector. Their name is XXXX XXXX XXXX	1

and my child died last year. The agent was rude and disrespectful. She called me after I made online disputes for my credit report. She told me on last Saturday	1
and my credit card maxed out to XXXX as a charge off. Due to this mishap	1
and my credit card was swiped XXXX consecutive days in a row. My credit card was charged for the XXXX night	1
and my credit report all in hand ) as well as what the account number this was in reference. The representative gave a number that was actually less than my original XXXX XXXX bill as well as having a completely different account number. I then proceeded to put them XXXX on speaker and told them I was calling XXXX XXXX directly to find out who actually owned my past due money to XXXX. XXXX XXXX once again tried to pass me off to a representative from XXXX and I stopped them and asked which company had my XXXX collection. She then stated XXXX is who was to collect not Pinnacle Credit Services and certainly not XXXX XXXX. That was literally the only information I could get from XXXX at all. They would not speak to me otherwise and I had to practically beg to get XXXX XXXX to tell me that. I proceeded to make the payment	1
and my credit report is clean. They have threatened arrest	1
and my credit reports all disagree. Despite emails to Navient and phone calls and multiple requests to speak with a supervisor	1
and my credit score has dropped from XXXX to XXXX. I have called the Chase auto loan dept	1
and my edler parents can not put money in a chase account in XXXX because there is no Chase branches in XXXX or Maryland. She kept telling me over and over to make other XXXX Travel arrangements. I can not bike to XXXX from XXXX	1
and my ex ( who I have n't been in contact with in 15 years ) and told all of them that I needed to contact them immediately or I would be sued. The messages were automated and the name of the "" rep '' was XXXX XXXX. I believe this company is actually a scam and not a legitimate debt collector.	1
and my ex wife has not been seen or heard from in three years with no way to contact her	1
and my ex-husband 's wife (? ) saying that I was going to get arrested if I did n't get in contact with them immediately. I spent my entire lunch hour assuring the people that I love that nothing was going to happen to me.	2
and my family is suffering greatly over this matter. WF lies and denies involvement in the matter on paper. I possess a written declaration from XXXX XXXX from the WF Ex Office declaring that WF has never	1
and my family was staying in a hotel because our house had been sold	1
and my gross income does not qualify me for an adjusted mortgage. The only solution they have offered is skipping a month of mortgage payments which is ridiculous because my income they are using is not based on my occupation but on my tax returns which are filed jointly with my wife who is not on the mortgage nor does she contribute to it. The most recent denial occurred on XX/XX/XXXX. I 'm requesting that Chase immediately lower my mortgage rate and should reimburse me {$30000.00} for financial damages since XX/XX/XXXX.	1
and my husband could not locate it at home	1
and my husbands CLOSED XXXX	1
and my identity will be stolen. I am not sure what to do at this point. I am scared.	2
and my insurance company. I cancelled all of my cards that day	1
and my insurance for the year had already been paid. RCS claimed that I had to be charged but never truly explained why. I kept up with my payments monthly until XXXX. As a single mother of XXXX and a home owner	1
and my job loss a couple years after	1
and my loan # XXXX	1
and my loan amount increased by the requisite {$300.00}. But XXXX never got the money -- or so they say -- and never applied the {$300.00} to my loan. Now I am out the whole {$300.00}. I called the companies twice ( once we did a conference call with representatives from both XXXX and Sallie Mae XXXX. They have been unable to resolve it and have not responded to me.	1
and my monthly payment was higher at {$930.00} than the {$900.00} I originally agreed to. I called LoanDepot about the situation and after further studying of the account they realized that mistakes had been made by the mortgage broker. I do n't have a full understanding of what exactly happened but it had something to with them not calculating my escrow correctly. They wanted me to refinance all over again to fix the discrepancies but I did not want to go through with the whole process with them again seeing as they already messed it up the first time. I was then told that to fix the situation	1
and my mortgage increases every month.	1
and my mortgage payments were current. I have made multiple phone calls to OCWEN to resolve this	1
and my mortgages	1
and my numerous requests to get clarity from the "" Escrow Department '' go ignored. I 'm opening this complaint after several rounds of "" phone tag '' and ignored emails.	1
and my original XXXX report shows XXXX charged off but also shows {$84.00} payments made XX/XX/XXXX of 2014. I disputed this original account because the amounts and payments did not seem right	1
and my original XXXX report shows XXXX charged off but also shows {$84.00} payments made in XXXX and XXXX of 2014. I disputed this original account because the amounts and payments did not seem right	1
and my payment was still used for interest. I called again and Sallie Mae stated that it is because it was a day after my due date. I have auto payment so I do n't understand how my additional payment would be used for future interest.	1
and my payments going to unapplied funds	1
and my payments have been set up on autodraft since the inception of the loan	1
and my phone number	1
and my phone number on it. I called the XXXX number for US Bank to tell them of the error and the connected me with the local branch directly. XXXX came on the line and asked what number was on the paper. When I gave her the number that it was to be faxed to she said that it was not the number that she faxed the form too. She did not apologize and she argued with me about the number being incorrect. She told me to come back in to the branch and she would re-fax the form and do a hard close on the account. I could not go to the branch today so she told me to contact the XXXX number again and the customer service bankers could close the account. I did that and while I was on the line with US Bank customer service XXXX contacted me again and told me that she spoke to the cashier that watched her fax the form and they XXXX agreed that the number she faxed it to was on the form so she was going to investigate further and get back to me. She is not taking responsibility for giving my banking information to a regular citizen and trying to put the blame on me for her error.	1
and my property value had also decreased approximately 40 % due to the housing market collapse. I filed an Appeal with the County Assessor to reduce my taxes in XXXX XXXX	1
and my refinance can not proceed without an accurate payoff. Please note : This mortgage and another mortgage on a different property closed at the same time with the same originator on identical Notes except for the principal amount and interest rate. The same firm is now servicing both mortgages	1
and my sale date. I just spoke with XXXX a representative in the Loss Mitigation Department on behalf of Mortgage Solutions of Colorado LLC. and was informed my file is complete and was forward to the processing department and is currently in line for review. However when I asked about the sale date XXXX informed me they	1

and my ward 's rent checks	1
and my wife	2
and my wife had lost her job. We spent years applying for home loan modifications that never seem to get anywhere. In the mean time we stopped paying the HELOC because the payment became to high and our home was very underwater. I was forced to file chapter XXXX bankruptcy as XXXX XXXX XXXX raised my payment while granting me a terrible loan modification. The terms were awful. My wife and I could not afford to relocate as I was no longer working. It was not until I found this website that I finally made a complaint about what I had been through with XXXX XXXX XXXX. With the help of your organization we were finally offered an affordable loan modification. We have been paying our loan mod since aprox - XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX.	1
and my wife is XXXX	1
and national origin. Please also referred to HAMP Handbook XXXX Chapter V Protections Against Unnecessary Foreclosure states the following:XXXX Suspension of Referral to Foreclosure-A servicer may not refer any loan to foreclosure or conduct a scheduled foreclosure sale ( except as provided under Section XXXX ) unless and until the servicer has resolved the Escalated Case in accordance with Section XXXX.

and need criminal lawyer. so they told me you have to send money asap by moneygram. so i sent {$1700.00} + {$35.00} ( fees ). Once they want me to send another half right away	1
and need my credit card company to look into remedying this situation. I called my credit card company and spoke with a representatives who stated my request must be in writing I obliged with documentation on XXXX XXXX	1
and never declined. I brought a printout and the bank teller 's name and phone contact to the XXXX XXXX store	1
and never have missed a payment nor received or received such poor customer service. I attempted to escalate before submitting this complaint	1
and never leave a message. This disturbs my work time often.	1
and never leaves any additional details. I know for a fact that I do not have any debts that have went unpaid. I am in college and still live at home with my parents and I have no bills. I did live in an apartment for a short while	1
and never missed a payment	1
and never missed or be late in any mortgage monthly payments. Then my mortgage was purchase/transfer to XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX turn my mortgage to a third party ( Ocwen Loan Servicing ) to handle the collection of mortgage monthly payments. Ocwen Loan Servicing	1
and never sent anything to underwriting	1
and no access to the account	1
and no communication. I was doing some other banking business the other day and was shown on my credit report that Allied Collection Services	1
and no foreclosure. I am submitting documents.	1
and no included in my chapter XXXX bankruptcy. The creditors are listed in my court documentation	2
and no one is taking the time to do their job properly.	1
and no record was generated. However XXXX payments were then processed	1
and no response. This is the pattern for this company which is why I am issuing this complaint.	1
and none of the representatives could explain why we were receiving the threats.	1
and none of them can tell me where the {$2000.00} came from. I feel I have paid my debt back	1
and not XXXX different houses. It is very obvious this is the same account listed twice	1
and not bank	1
and not been late over the years. It caused my minimum payment to go from around {$450.00} and {$350.00} respectively to around {$800.00} and {$500.00} per month. I contacted them immediately to please take the rate back down	1
and not delinquent till XX/XX/XXXX ) again for this year and they gave us till the XX/XX/XXXX to pay them or they were going to add escrow to our loan again??	1
and not for any other reason/s. In my history with Citi Bank I have NEVER BEEN LATE	1
and not give me access to the protection of overdraft. Even though	1
and not in collection. We have asked them in writing to stop. They ignore the requests. Last week we were called at least XXXX times by Wells Fargo auto dial	1
and not me	1
and not me individually	1
and not my home. Ultimately the loans were both re-structured	1
and not only is NCI demanding 20 %	1
and not only that but cupboards	1
and not wait until the bill was stopping me from getting something. Filing this complaint due to harassment and request that my debt is settled with another collection agency or the original creditor or they uphold the agreement made between the original creditor and debt collection agency.	1
and noted that the funds had been incorrectly distributed. I spoke with a representative ( I believe on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) to have this corrected to reflect my initial request made on the statement stub.	1
and nothing except a headache. We had to make our payment in XX/XX/XXXX	1
and nothing is received. I am not even worried. I happened to go to the branch the other day	1
and nothing. I am no where in their computers. I asked XXXX if they could send me a letter stating that	1
and noticed that I was being charged a higher amount. My payoff amount was noted at {$12000.00}. I worked through the amortization	1
and now I 'm told I need to go to DMV and request Title. I paid in full {$15000.00} and a year and a half later they still have a lien! How many vehicles to they reposes with a false lien?????? I have to take a day off work to go to DMV and find another buyer.	1
and now I am receiving upwards of 10 phone calls a DAY to retrieve {$18000.00} for the private loan. Not only am I being harassed	1
and now I have no access to any documents to either Bill Me later Or Paypal. to know when this happened and how much and when I went over. Now I am paying thousands of dollars of interest on goods purchased that I can not send back.. I am also XXXX after 34 years and will have difficulty paying back. They called this am and told me I did no pay last month 's bill which I have been paying them over the phone. I will check on that so I paid up through XXXX. If I check my statement and I have paid it	1
and now XXXX of their employees is calling me on the phone asking about the payment	1
and now a new statement showing {$7400.00} past due. This is truly unbelievable. Do I need to take my savings and sue this company? They are in breach of contract	1
and now attempting to force a buyer to pay well above market value for the property. This has also exposed the borrower to homeowner association dues which will survive a foreclosure	1
and now currently am not.	1
and now decided to foreclose without any notice or proper advertisment of my foreclosure. On XXXX XXXX I received a letter from Ocwen stating that my loan had been postponed and that as of this date	1
and now have paid my lawyer to write the bank a letter asking the money to be released and communicate with me as to what is going on. The Bank letter gave them a deadline of XXXX XXXX	1
and now have to come from out of state	2
and now is back to Ditech. In the course of the loan process there was a "" Quit Claim Deed '' that had been signed and notarized to remove our son off the title. He is not listed on the mortgage. Ditech or the title company did not record the "" Quit Claim Deed '' from what we can tell. It is in our copy of the loan documents	1
and now most recently known as XXXX XXXX XXXX Who by the way receivived payment for a fraudulent MERS # XXXX was paid to Kyanite on XX/XX/XXXX after Metlife home Loans had been Paid XXXX XXXX but you do n't want to hear that they 're crooks.	1
and now there are NSF fees for the items we have on AutoPay that have come through and could not be stopped. We have attempted to speak with them	1
and now there is a motion filed with the courts ( by the creditor 's attorney ) to change the jurisdiction of the case up here to where I live.	1
and now they 're trying to force me to pay another {$21.00} for a service I never knowingly asked for. Just another way the U.S. government is allowing credit bureaus ( and corporations in general ) to act indecently and mistreat the public.	1
and now they are trying to charge me {$350.00} for a cancellation fee. They rented out the room without telling me anything about it and were originally trying to charge me the full amount until I called. This is criminal. I did not live there and cancelled within 24 hours.	1
and now we are paying for it since i will have paid almost 7 times as much back towards the original XXXX loan. Attached are pictures of the loan information from Navient. This one bill accounts for almost XXXX % of my income every month	1
and now we were late on the current bill. We also saw that there were XXXX charges for "" hospital tax '' billed on one day from our escrow. I called XXXX XXXX again and was told that those payments were toward the late fees which XXXX was supposed to pay - so they took our money out of escrow to apply toward bills they had promised they would pay and called it something else .... I do n't know if they were trying to cover up that they were taking our money to pay for their mistake or what. But to this date	1
and now works in bankruptcy	1
and of course they do n't know and simply told me that I have to wait 60 days. Gap credit is the most incompetent credit card I have ever experienced	1
and of course with the US mail so messed up who can say when they will receive your payment.. I mailed my payment on the XXXX of XXXX they received and posted it on the XXXX	1
and offer a discount on debt if I pay within a month. I confirmed with XXXX there is no debt and they told me to disregard this notice. Per online research	1
and offered for us to pay about XXXX which is what the debt showed as early this year ... i just checked this again and it went up to almost XXXX! This debt used to showed as of year XX/XX/XXXX and i checked it again and they changed it to XXXX. We reside in XXXX and under the statue of limitations it says that they should get rid of this issue next year ( 5 yrs )	1
and offsetting credit balance by sufficient security funds held by HSBC BANK I deposited for the credit card	1
and on 3 occasions they told me the issue was resolved. On 2 occasions they promised me a call back	1
and on what basis is it made??? XX/XX/XXXX I transferred about {$400.00} over to their card and a 0 % interest rate	1
and once I found out about it	1
and once received I would pay it. I have one letter indicating that the mortgage rate would increase and that there was a new amount	1
and one pays half the spread on buy and half on sell. 20 years ago when I traveled for business I used my US Credit Cards because I was simply charged the spread	1
and one that I had been laid off from	1
and online as well. I tried talking to a couple of so-called "" supervisors	1
and online communications that they would be able to accept semi-monthly payments ( XXXX payments a month ) and suggested that those payments would be applied immediately. After obtaining my loan and making semi-monthly payments I noticed that Quicken Loans would wait until the second payment is received before applying the payments. After a reply from QL via XXXX	1
and only after researching FHA loans did I come to the conclusion that these should have all been fixed. My opinion is that the Wells Fargo representative was solely looking out for himself	1
and only apply the remainder towards the balance. In addition	1
and only eight weeks to go	1
and only half my money was returned. BOA refuses to give me back a {$120.00} fee charged to my account when this action in the first place was not lawful	1
and only having 18 months left. We like to know our rights and how to stop the madness.	1
and only saw a direct debit payable to FIA Card Services	1
and only states that there will be a balance transfer fee.	1
and only these documents	1
and only with	1
and or XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and or a federally required debt collection notification letter sent to my address over said debt.	1
and original creditor account number being XXXX.	1
and other charges on the card. I paid off the card to a XXXX balance in XXXX 2015 and yet	1

The payoff statement I received also has {$2800.00} added for amount due the Trustee Service who has n't actually started the foreclosure process yet. If SLS would have given me the proper credit for having paid the taxes and insurance	1

This company and there colleagues have been felony harassing my family for over 4yrs. Aqua illegally sued us without our knowledge and have been trying to force us out of our home for the last 4yrs. We even tried to pay these crooks 3yrs ago and finicial systems of greenbay told us they do n't do written contracts. Finicial systems of greenbay told us they only do verbal contracts and we knew that was n't right. They had 1 of there XXXX ( agents ) damage our sons car so I called the police and I told the officer what has been going on. The officer told me not to pay them because without a contract we have no proof that we have been paying them. I also came to the realization that there ca n't be a contract because the case is supposed to be closed! Once again these companies are caught using illegal practices. Aqua has almost XXXX XXXX complaints that have been submitted against there company and there affiliates. All these victims saying the same thing ca n't be lying. The next time we talk to Aqua will be in court with our lawyer	1

and received a Medical Pension. The pension brings me about {$4000.00} a month. The other lender said it should be reported as {$5000.00} a month as there is no tax taken. When I brought this to XXXX attention he agreed and re-submitted. I then obtained a loan about XXXX higher but it was obvious XXXX did not know what he was doing. As the loan was finally funding I was asked to sign doc 's about a mile from my escrow office on a Sunday evening. As I did this I questioned why we were not signing at escrow the next morning. Then I discovered XXXX and his wife were now trying to charge me {$250.00} for the signatures. When I questioned it was dropped to {$75.00}. I then discovered that changes were made to my closing costs. The price increased {$2900.00}	1

and reporting to credit bureaus that I 'm late on my payments. This has ruined my credit report with negative items of late payment when the payments from my checking account cleared well ahead of delinquent date. This would have to considered a financial fraud to co-mingle funds when my payment is strictly principal & interest.

and she hung up on me. I am in desperate need of help. I feel like my rights have been violated.	1
and she informed me that Wells Fargo could not return the {$950.00} ( that they fully admit is a credit ) to me because their accounting system would only allow them to return the full amount ( {$1700.00} ) that was paid on XXXX XXXX. Upon hearing the explanation from the supervisor	1
and she informed me that the statue of limitations started over when I made the XXXX payment because of IL law on debt collection. I was n't told that the beginning when I made arrange to make payment. I was also told that I could be sued because the statute of limitations. I think that she told me this information to scare me into paying off the debt or neglected to tell me about the statue of limitations in the beginning in order for to XXXX me into something that I did n't know about.	1
and she met that arrangement. In addition to the complaints	1
and she moved out when the lease was up. When I learned about the collection	1
and she never answered by question constantly atacking me saying I did n't know what a loan was.	1
and she never transferred the call. She said to me that she needed to know why I wanted a SUP I advised her to complain on her she still continued to speak and make me feel "" threatened "" and upset. I am currently suffering from a XXXX in which I am not allowed to have any XXXX and this is why I fell behind in my payments. She made me feel like I did something wrong and worse than I already fill. I then had to call back and request another rep XXXX to speak with a SUP he transferred me immediately. In speaking with the sup he advised me that I could set up my arrangement for XXXX and XXXX as previously requested and in addition he advised me that they had the correct card on file that the very rude rep I spoke with first did claims that I did not have on file. In summary	1
and she refused. I requested a supervisor and she refused to transfer me to a supervisor. After she hung up on me	1
and she said "" yes ''. I submitted a request before XX/XX/XXXX.	1
and she said XXXX XXXX years ago	2
and she said because I did not pay the {$75.00} for XX/XX/XXXX. I told her	1
and she said she could not hear me from the car and insisted that I write down information for her. On XXXX XXXX	1
and she said that they should be removed from my XXXX Credit Report and then had XXXX Hospital email Valarity	1
and she sent me a check for the retainer and put me in touch with her alleged ex-husband. The arrangement was that he was to send me checks for the settlement amounts	1
and she spoke to me as if I did not even belong in their bank.	1
and she stated that she tried to leave me voicemails but could not because my inbox was full	1
and she stated that there was no need to continue making payments and depending on exactly what day we closed I could possibly have two to three months before the first mortgage payment would be due on the new loan. I was eventually contacted by XXXX and asked why have I not made my mortgage payment. I explained to her the conversation that I had with XXXX XXXX	1
and she sure did at XXXX and she left a voice mail as well. I will attach the vm and the phone log. The bill was paid the day before and has always been paid.	1

I was told I had to hand deliver my XXXX payments to their office at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 I drove to their offices and made my XXXX payment for {$320.00}. The payment receipt is attached in the file "" payment receipts.pdf '' I noticed that the principal balance had increased to {$2600.00} and nothing was applied towards the principal balance from my payment.

and that I requested validation	4
and that I should be receiving a check for the balance within 30 days. They put my accounts in a no debit status and I had no access to my funds. I called them repeatedly	1
and that I should keep looking for a traditional home as a back up. We told him we wanted this home and will do what we need to do to get it. Every time he asked for documents	1

and that I was not informed of this error in a timely manner. Furthermore	1
and that I was now ready to pay a monthly amount that is more fitting to my financial needs. End result : after speaking with many customer service representatives and supervisors such as XXXX	1
and that I wasnt going to sign again. They told my mom and sister	1
and that I would be eligible for my secured card to "" graduate '' to an unsecured card within a year as long as I maintained positive history with the bank.	1
and that I would deal with XXXX	1
and that I would need to contact them ( AIM ) directly. I called them on Wednesday	1
and that I would not be charged fees if the account were opened with a minimum balance of {$100.00}	1
and that I would receive documentation to that effect within 7-10 business days. The documentation did not arrive and the company kept phoning my wife to demand payment. I finally got through to Customer Service ( after fighting with Collections again ) on XXXX XXXX and was assured that my account had been fully credited and showed a {$0.00} balance ( in spite of the fact that their computerized system had just informed me it was {$450.00} ). I will believe these assurances when I get my next statement. In the best case scenario	1
and that XXXX XXXX and I have been divorced for quite some time. She kept refusing to give me any further information and said I would just have to wait until I 'm served	1
and that a letter had just been mailed denying the Mortgagor 's request for a short sale and payment amount. The Mortgagor asked why did the previous letter from XXXX states that an "" application in not required? "". XXXX confirmed there being no need to have an application for modification on file. As well	1
and that a second escrow account analysis would be performed in XXXX. We waited for an update and	1
and that any negative reports affecting my credit be rectified.	1
and that even if I sent them it would not accelerate the amortization of my mortgage -- i.e. they would still treat my bi-weekly payments as monthly.	1
and that he needed to remove the number. On XXXX XXXX I was called at the same number by Santander I informed her this was not a good contact number and that I had previously told them they can not call me at that number.	1
and that he would check with her and get back to me. XXXX DID call me back	1
and that he would have pride of ownership. I put in a {$2000.00} down payment and agreed to cosign the loan ( Regions # XXXX ). My Father had done the same for me when I graduated from college and I appreciated his assistance. The intent being that my stepson would handle the car payments	1
and that if I 'm do n't pay right away I 'm going to be arrested and put in jail. is a very nasty person that do n't want to listen to reasoning. I 'm very stress out with this situation.	1
and that if a debt is not owed the consumer has protection from these crimes. It is also clear that if a debt is time barred it is also not able to collect and by their own admission this alleged debt they have created is time barred and i have given evidence of their unlawful actions. Select Portfolio Servicing Inc. ( SPS ) is using XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as a biased Trustee	1
and that is her only income	1
and that is simply unacceptable. Although students and parents are borrowing from Sallie Mae	1
and that is why they believe I owe them money ; when again this is incorrect. I have submitted proof of insurance online	1
and that it had been sent to underwriting for the finishing touches. They also told us to hold off on our XXXX Mortgage payment because the new mortgage with the new dollar amount would take effect. Then they received notification of the complaint I made against them	1
and that it has exceeded the statute of limitations on municipal debts. Specifically	1
and that it is only for financing in store	1
and that it may take time to fix said mistake ( s )	1
and that it unfairly profited from receiving kickbacks in connection with lender-based insurance including in the form of commissions. ''	1
and that it was a gmail account	1
and that it would be at my address within 3 days time. It was not. I called again	1
and that it would be resolved. I still have not received the credit. This is ridiculous. I am no longer charging to this card because obviously they ca n't figure it out. USAA owes me {$6.00}	1
and that maybe you can assist me	1
and that my account was delinquent with the summary page showing that a payment was still due for XXXX XXXX	1
and that my due date was n't until XXXX/XXXX/2016	1
and that my payment really was n't that much anyway. I explained that my rent is $ XXXX ( which is cheap in XXXX )	1
and that my payments made had gone towards the "" collection and fees. '' When I explained that the interest was 40 % of the bill	1
and that per my letter he was not supposed to be attempting to collect on the debt. This agent proceeded to threaten me that he will ruin my credit if i do n't agree to pay. I advised him to look at their records and it will clearly show I requested a Verification of Debt. He repeatedly just asked so you are refusing to pay the debt over and over. I continued to advise him I am not refusing to pay and it was an invalid debt that was disputed with their agency months prior to his call. He continued to disregard what i was telling him about violating the FDCPA and that he could not act like this was the first collection call regarding the bill. I told him by law their time passed and even on the call he could not provide the information I requested 4 months prior. I advised him to research his records and to stop calling me because he is in violation of several laws. The agent hung up on me. A few weeks later I noticed the collection account on my credit report. I sent the agency a certified letter	1
and that set me behind.. I then entered the mortgage modification maze and then the bank made my payments so high I could not afford them.	1
and that she could not call me and started threaten me to take some exaction. I interrupted her to explain my situation	1
and that she could set me up on a pay schedule	1
and that she is not an employee of XXXX.	1
and that the call was being taped. My ex husband have been divorced for over 7 years. Based on my understanding of the FDCPA her actions were in violation. I would ask that the company be contacted and cease phone calls to my phone number and discontinue disclosing personal information about people on 3rd party VM. Of note	1
and that the due date for this information is XXXX XXXX	1
and that the fee would be cleared as soon as I made a payment in XXXX. However	1
and that the interest rate would cripple me for the next 25 years. Private student loans are predator	1
and that the kind of roboocall they are doing is illegal. He said hey	1
and that the only principal that I am responsible to payoff is the interest bearing portion of principal of my loan. She confirmed this each time I asked her. So	1
and that the person they are trying to reach does not live here. He said he would remove my phone number from the file. I am still getting calls from them	1
and that the re-aging of my account is incorrect and unfair. The response to my XXXX dispute was to change the account to "" Discharged in Bankruptcy '' and the Date of XXXX Delinquency remains XXXX. I feel that all three of my disputes were not investigated fully and if it had been the information would have been deleted from my credit report.	1
and that their process would be faster because I was an existing customer. After the other lender parted ways with the broker I knew	1
and that there is no way I can find on their site to close the account	1
and that there was not a social security number associated with the aforementioned account ( based upon their records ).	1
and that there would be no further issues regarding our permanent modification.	1
and that they 'd cease the calls.	1
and that they can not verify debt. i dont know how credit agencies are verifying this then	2
and that they close the account. They have not responded to this letter at all.	1
and that they had ( begrudgingly/reluctantly ) agreed to remove the charges and fees and put the account back in good standing. After yet more wrangling with them	1
and that they have NO evidence of ever contacting me about any pending charges	1
and that they refuse to respond to our phone calls and voicemails. We have to contact the Ombudsman 's office to get ANY response whatsoever from Ocwen.	1
and that they should remove the item immediately and permanently. Attached is the necessary documentation required to stipulate my position that the 7-year rule applies.	2

and the form I filled out & that I have identity theft with all my information they were requesting ( per what is on their Website ).

and the onle secure portal does not show my letter. The supervisors only tell me that they will send out the letter again. I need help. Someone please help me get the decline letters from Capital one so I can know why I am declined. The Application or Reference number to the XXXX application is XXXX. I need help.	1
and the only information we are getting from BOA is that is has been sent. I know if the wire has been	1
and the only response after my debt validation letters were court papers -- no facts	1
and the only thing that he says is that he will send it out. I asked if it was easier he could fax it to me	1
and the origination branch was located at XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and the other for the XXXX student loan in the amount of $XXXX dollars. These lawsuits have essentially ruined my credit	1
and the other half their staff could see the XXXX-payment but did n't have the authority to remove it. They told me to call back in an hour ( at midnight ) and maybe things would be different. I called back the next day	1
and the other on an interest only variable loan. They did this without my consent	1
and the palm trees were carelessly ripped out	1
and the paperwork was sent to me. I faxed my application and received my confirmation. My confirmation stated the dates of my forbearance were for past dates and that my next payment was due in XX/XX/XXXX.	1
and the patriot act. State Farm Bank and XXXX XXXX office was NEGLIGENT in failing to follow and committed fraud when they allowed the present applicant to sign that all information was correct and had been verified.	1
and the payments are being credited to my loan. Wells Fargo	1
and the payments went up from aprox. {$1900.00} per month to almost {$2600.00} per month.	1
and the payments were a lot more higher then what i was informed	1
and the person does not even live here.	1
and the person said that the loan department said that 's how they do it. I went into a branch to complain	1
and the phone number is XXXX. The balance was XXXX which was already paid	1
and the phone numbers they provide on their website do n't work. We have lost trust that we will get help and although we are paying or mortgage. we have bills that ca n't be paid ont he other side like car payments	1
and the price of the hotel going toward {$1000.00} in spend needed to get me to the XXXX free hotel rooms ( which I could use toward my upcoming honeymoon )	1
and the primary beneficiary with the requested documents. Huntington Bank 's failure to comply with the subpoena is creating additional stress	1
and the process is being held up by Citi Mortgage. At this point I am concerned that I will lose the buyer and have to start the process XXXX again.	1
and the process took up my entire XXXX and XXXX.	1
and the reaffirmation places us even further in arrears. They have repeatedly used the threat of foreclosure on our home as a club to end all discussion or negotiation between parties. There were things not disclosed about this loan	1
and the reference number they left is XXXX. My phone number that they keep calling is a landline XXXX. I work out of my home and I use this line for business	1
and the refinancing of my high interest car loan	2
and the remainder would be available for withdrawal XXXX/XXXX/15. Subsequently	1
and the remark is still on my record. Please assist in getting this cleared. Thank you!	1
and the rep pretty much told me that he is busy and I am just a number / case load for him. I do not want to lose my home	1
and the report	1
and the reporting to XXXX XXXX and XXXX Is not accurate. In compliance with FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 8 ) ( D ). Also Midland is not suppose to report a collection account under "" revolving open accounts '' Showing it is an open account on monthly terms with XXXX plus lates. This is a violation. Midland is a collection agency and did NOT extend me any credit.	1
and the representative also told us Chase owed us a little over {$900.00} for the remaining money in escrow. Again	1
and the rest had been applied the lower-interest balances. I contacted Synchrony Bank by phone and a representative said he was fixing it so the payment would be applied to the promotional balances. He had no explanation for why my payment had been allocated improperly in the first place	1
and the rest was done over the phone. I never received a card	1
and the rewards have still not been applied. Here are dates of each phone call and notes about what was discussed.	1
and the salesman forced me to get the XXXX knowing I did n't qualify. My credit score is low	1
and the same thing appeared on the ATM 'S screen. They charged XXXX transactions to my debit card even dough I did n't receive the money.	1
and the send in a ticket to have it fixed	1
and the standard practice was always the same!! Ask for condition	1
and the statement about ordering the base model is false. He deliberately lied and made false representations to Bank of America to get the money back. By definition ; he has committed fraud against Bank of America. I have supporting documents that prove that the firearm that the merchant ordered is	1
and the supervisor "" promised '' me that my credit card will be arriving on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and that he will be calling me to follow up if I received it. I did not receive my credit card.	1
and the third has to do with their use of "" mortgage servicers '' to manage their mortgages and their lack of accountability or responsibility to their members when using the "" mortgage servicers. "" For the first issue	1
and the third party company ; XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2015 and XX/XX/2015. Notarized copy by certified mail shortly after. No responses as of today XX/XX/2015. The car has still not been returned to me.	1
and the whole process took hours.	2
and the {$10000.00} and {$12000.00} loans were from XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ... ).	1
and their appraisal that they ordered and they are still requesting that I sign into this loan. I have XXXX young children and do n't want to start over. They are putting the balance on the end of the loan as a balloon and restarting the loan on a 40 year term to make the payments affordable. But I feel that this is unjust and that a bank as big as Bank of America should not treat people this way. If I moved they would only get {$190000.00} for this property on top of have to spend between $ XXXX {$20000.00} to make it move In ready. I need help ... ..	1
and their check to me needs to be made out to me only ( not to me and my contractor ).	1
and their customer service has been appalling. My final conclusion is that B & B Auto is a company that is not honest and will sell a car to anyone if it means them making a dollar. They are disrespectful and do n't value their customers. Sadly I have heard this about them before	1
and their own billing statement even shows that tuition was credited back to me	1
and their policy is not to accept my payments while i 'm applying for modification and now they add attorneys fees and late fees	1
and their programming needed to change so incorrect information would not be accepted as it could be used for identity theft. There was no response that any corrective action would be taken to rectify this security breach of an individual 's personal information. I then requested to speak with a supervisor and spoke with a woman	1
and their requirements to earn these points they offer to get new business accounts. It is an unfair practice that needs to be changed.	1
and their written promise to not perpetuate any court action against any home in which they had filed falsified ( robo-signed ) titles with the county recorders and the courts. OCWEN identified me and my home as one of the victims of their illegal action and paid me {$1100.00} in XXXX XXXX. In spite of that payment and their promises contained in their settlement	1
and then I was told I could not refinance due to my debt to income ratio. My loan to value ratio is now approx. 61.5 %. My debt level is higher due to medical bills. So now I am stuck with PMI and there is no reason I should be paying this monthly expense. I called yet again today and was told that the PMI will not fall off of my loan for any reason until XX/XX/XXXX.	1
and then I would have to go into a branch as fill out something and then it would take about 10 days for them to investigate the claim and after that I would have access to my funds again. The checks are going to bounce by then. Not only will I lose the house	1
and then XXXX XXXX XXXX has notified us by letter dated XXXX XXXX 2015	1
and then a XXXX $ late fee when that was not paid. Again	1
and then asked what this was regarding. She said that legal paperwork had been delivered to that address for me and since I had not responded they were attempting to get a response from me. I asked what sort of legal paperwork and was told it was a complaint filed with the XXXX XXXX Sheriff 's Office. I said again that I had not received any paperwork. She transferred me to the "" legal department '' where a man then picked up the phone. I again verified that the address was incorrect and asked what this was regarding. I was told that it was regarding an account of mine that was in collections and had been transferred to this law firm. He said it was regarding an accounts previously had with XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$1300.00}. He stated that he was going to email me paperwork that would require my electronic signature to agree to voluntary repayment in order to stop further legal action. He asked me to make a verbal agreement on a recorded line to make payments on this account. I told him I would not make any agreement without proper notification and delivery of paperwork. At that time	1
and then began to look into the issue	1
and then called today to set up a payment on XXXX XXXX. I was told by the representative that I was breaking the program rules by setting up the payment so late	1
and then charge a late fee. That issue was finally resolved after several months. Then I make payments through their online system which they will not accept. When I call the company	1
and then close my account so that my credit score is restored to what it should be.	1
and then deducted another {$410.00} from my bank account on XXXX XXXX. I called both the bank and the auto finance company to explain the situation	1
and then discovered that there was a pre-existing home equity line of credit on the property which was overlooked by the predecessor to Seterus	1
and then followed up with a letter dated XXXX XXXX	1
and then immediately told me that the XXXX I had was activated and ready to use.	1
and then insisted on asking for my credit card information. After informing them I do not owe the debt	1
and then not being able to easily refund the stolen funds is certainly another. Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.	1
and then only after the Attorney General of MN office had been contacted and was working on this case. During this time Seterus called us weekly and we always took the calls and we always explained what needed to happen and that we are contesting the loan. Once we received the information it was identify they sent the information to the wrong address. We have continue to pay the old monthly payment and will do so until they correct their mistake. We have continue to ask them to remove all late fee 's and interest charged in XXXX because of their mistakes. Our mailing address did NOT change in XXXX or XXXX and this as a mistake do to Seterus record keeping errors NOT ours. We also have asked them to correct all the negative reporting to credit agencies and provide us with a report showing us that this has been done with a letter stating it was their fault incase an agency comes asking in the future. We have been contesting the lone until this point and due to terms of the loan they should have stop late fees and foreclose process. On several cases including the following I was told the case was being contested and ALL late fees would be on hold- Including-On XXXX XXXX XXXX said she was doing this ; XXXX XXXX said she was doing this on XXXX	1
and then paying the balance	1
and then put me on hold. She came back and told me that "" the reason my monthly payment was increased by {$5.00} was for increased property taxes and homeowners insurance. "". I could n't believe it! It was like she had never heard me describing the problem in the first place. The employee seemed so confused that I asked to speak with a supervisor	1
and then refused to close the account because I could not provide the phone number originally used in opening the account. Again	1
and then resubmitted all my information for review of modification. After reending documents over 4 times when the stated they "" could n't find them ''	1
and then saying they can not help me without mailing in a request	1
and then stopped paying	1
and then take the time to notify all my reoccurring charge accounts of the new number. I can understand how a scam company might somehow get a false charge posted to my account	1
and then the orignal debtor changes the amount	1
and then their "" findings '' would be sent to me in the mail XXXX hours later. I could live with this	1
and then they commission my neighbors to give call them as soon as they see me	1
and then they decide who is right.	1
and then they received the car back	1
and then they take the amount of the balance and report is a what the payment should be making you look like your debt ratio is bad and that you ca n't afford a home.it has been deceiving me. it 's like they have no rules to follow and can just put anything on you anywhere	3
and then they tell me I do not qualify for the modification because of HAMP rules. I am not sure why they are telling me at the end of the trial period	1
and then to each successive balance bearing the next highest rate of interest	1
and then was disconnected. I then chose the "" live chat '' option online	1
and then we will help you. When I questioned XXXX on the fact he told me let your account go past due and then we will be able to offer you programs I was a little upset. Here I am trying to avoid not making payments	1
and then withdraws the benefit in the middle of cardholder year after the fee is paid. This is classic bait and switch and US Bank should be investigated for it.	1
and there has been no activity on this debt since that time! They are not reporting the correct dates.	1
and there has been no correspondence received from them.	1
and there is 100 % good feedback. The issue is Paypal refuses to release funds where the product has been paid for	1
and there is no balance owing. I received letter from EOS CCA collection office on XXXX/XXXX/2016. Here is copy of my letter to them. I also have submitted check to them	1
and there is no language that says I only have a 48 month limit for deferment. When I disputed that claim on the phone Navient representatives were dismissive	1
and there is no one I can talk to.	1
and there office saying the documents were received.	1
and there should be accountability when changes are made so that mistakes can be corrected	1
and there solution was for me to make XXXX payments a month when they know I could n't even make one .... I also needed to change my tags over to the new state of residence and they refused to release the title to the state for them to issue me tags. So now it has been a year and my tags are going to expire in 2 weeks	1
and there was no additional identifying information about the payee	1
and there was no auction. After about an hour	1
and there was nothing PennyMac would do to stop the draw. Since the funds would not be there	1
and there would be a {$19000.00} balloon payment at maturation. I turned down the modification because of the balloon clause. My relationship manager pressured me into accepting the modification	1
and there would not be a 30 day late marked on my credit report. I took their advice. Fast forward a month to XX/XX/XXXX	1
and therefore	1
and therefore did not know that my modification offer was not a HAMP	1
and therefore they have no authority to begin the foreclosure process by sending us a NOD.	1
and therefore they would not let the agreement expire. A few weeks went by and when I finally heard back I was informed that they could not verify anything under my name with XXXX. I reminded them that the loans are not under my name	1
and these have always been from local vendors or individuals with whom we do business regularly. I have complained about this regularly	1
and they	1
and they acknowledged that none of the phone calls were answered. ( Navient had all of my contact info in a separate parent plus account ) Naviant destroyed my good credit	1
and they admitted they did n't do what was agreed upon	1
and they advised me that I needed to speak to Experian XXXX and that there was nothing they could do.	1
and they advised me that they do n't report anything to the credit reporting agencies and that I needed to consult with an attorney. Nevertheless I 'm getting tired of the run around and the time its taking to resolve this. Especially when the XXXX other credit reporting agencies have since removed the negative information from my file.	1
and they agreed to it	1
and they all agreed that it was a mistake because i was not owing my apartment that period.	1
and they apologized and told me they would get the reporting fixed and I would receive notice in 5-7 days when it was complete. I simultaneously disputed the negative information with the reporting agencies. Over a month passed	1
and they are also closed. How can I track down what happened with my settlement and make the collections stop?	1
and they are asking for documents I already sent on numerous occasions ( i.e. hardship letter ) I 'm skeptical about WF record retention systems for email communication and faxes they received from me and others. When it was time to resolve WF 's request for a subordination from the XXXX lender on the loan ( yet another delay tactic )	1
and they are aware of this. They leave messages that say	1
and they are closed. The only thing that should be on my credit reports is the XXXX of XXXX	1
and they are in XXXX New York . I knew then they were definitely a scam. Since I contacted them	1
and they are offering me a reduced amount to be paid? I told the agent on the phone that i did not received any letter from XXXX XXXX House	1
and they are refusing to submit the offer to the investor for decisioning. They are refusing to allow any sort of review on the file for a short sale.	1
and they are still attempting to go forth with the motion despite my insistence on the fact that I did not make whatever purchases they are accusing me of	1
and they are telling me they once again did not mail XXXX. I am on the phone with XXXX id # XXXX who claims to be a supervisor yelling at me telling me i am lying. It is appalling that all i want is XXXX statement to pay my bill. I have XXXX mortgages and XXXX car payments. Please explain why this is the only company that can not get me a statement. I am now talking with XXXX	1
and they are threatening to garnish my wages which I do n't think they can do. Something illegal is happening here and I am getting tired of it. I can not possibly have an outstanding debt or I would not have my home.	1
and they are working on fixing it. But it has been almost 2 years	1
and they asked if I wrote it. I told them I wrote it but XXXX XXXX added the name. Chase refused to reverse the transaction despite my complaints. I then called Chase to get the name of the bank the check cleared through. Chase informed me they DO N'T KNOW what bank cleared the check	1
and they avoid the subject and say they 'll call back later.	1
and they became more and more threatening ; and calls were also made to some of my family members. I again contacted the lawyer	1
and they blocked me saying I have to contact them with multiple proofs of identity by mail with a personal check. I went to their Victim Fraud page	1
and they bought the bank. Really? If they bought the bank	1
and they ca n't even confirm they 've received my fax. Still	1
and they can find no credit information or credit report on us in which to reinstate the credit limit - Very curious because Lowes provide this credit card in XX/XX/XXXX along with original credit limit. As a result of all of this all of the Lowes ' credit underwriters are talking in circles without saying facts other than "" try back in 90 days for a credit increase '' - What?	1
and they can not attempt to threaten me to do so.	2
and they can not remove the charge. I have been given the typical run-around	1
and they can not verify this agencies claims. I would like this matter resolved and would like the harassment and threats to stop.	1
and they can still deny me for the HARP program.	1
and they claimed they were going to modify our loan via the FHA Hamp 2 program. However	1
and they consistently reassured me that the "" late payment '' status on my paper bill was just a formality during this process and will correct itself once the paperwork is finalized. It took the mortgage company 11 months to "" finalize '' the paperwork. This mortgage company reported to the XXXX credit bureaus that I was 120 days late for 11 consecutive months. This does not correctly reflect my payment history	1
and they continue to call me before XXXX XXXX despite me telling them not to.	1
and they continue to call.	1
and they decided to "" sign me up '' for their in-house insurance. They have now added an additional $ 120 monthly fee to my mortgage. I have tried to call	1
and they denial	1
and they did n't even give me the chance to do so. it was just for them ; to be able to suddenly close it without notice	2
and they did n't report the account as closed to the credit agencies.	1
and they did not appear to grant it as they said they sent me a message	1
and they did not give me a sufficient explanation. I followed up via a message through my account when I was logged in but no reply. Without a reasonable explanation	1
and they did not have the original document. I then contacted their corporate office	1
and they discovered that my relationship accts had not been set up properly ; so they linked my accounts and gave me my retro-active interest. After that	1
and they do not have the check in front of them.The bank policy is to take your money	1
and they do not intend to send me any proof. I fear that this negligence and incompetence on their part will end with me having to pay a debt that is not mine in order to clear the record of this bogus debt now associated with my name and address. And even if they have taken action to correct this fiasco	1
and they do not participate under the HAMP program. If they do not participate under the HAMP program	1
and they do not respond to emails.	1
and they dropped me out of school and told me to come back in 30 days or so. I was very XXXX off.	1
and they either refuse to answer my calls and put me on hold or they refuse to give me a supervisor to talk with. This is an ongoing issue that stems from their model. It goes from if you situation or finances change	1
and they foreclosed in XX/XX/XXXX despite the Rescission of the loan	1
and they gave me a lawyer name	1
and they had approved a short sale. We sent in a settlement request to US bank for the XXXX lien on XX/XX/XXXX with no return calls. We have called over XXXX times with no answers. Finally we got in touch with someone and they have told us the timeline and the buyer I have will no longer be able to purchase. I Need US Bank to escalate and settle my request once and for all QUICKLY in order for me to sell my house through the approved short sale process. THEY are our ONLY hold up!	1
and they had no such record. A week or so later	1
and they had reported it and my credit score took a huge hit. This has also created more damage in our business since now I can not apply for anything. We have still yet to hear back from Ocwen in regards to my loan modification Status after 4 Months. I want to file a complaint & maybe if somehow someone from your department could look into this	1
and they have announced foreclosure auction on XX/XX/XXXX!!!!! Need Division of Banks to call Ditech at XXXX IMMEDIATELY to ask for a 60 day postponement of the sale	1
and they have caused me XXXX and have made me afraid of answering the phone in fear of homelessness in doing so. They have also made deliberate attempts to embarrass me in front of my clients while I 'm at work. They also would only accept payments through a pay service that charged {$12.00} payments for every transaction and forced me to set up XXXX payments at a time beforehand. They treated me like I was dirt	1
and they have chosen to ignore my messages.	1
and they have done this to XXXX of people. The debt on my credit report	1
and they have just confirmed my name is STILL ON THE ACCOUNT.	1
and they have promised to fix the problem	1
and they have records stating that my return was off set due to the dept of taxation for the state of louisiana.	1
and they have said time and time again that they would not try and collect the debt anymore. Now it keeps showing up on my credit report	1
and they have taken {$12.00} out of my checking account for Transfer Fee. There was a reversal of {$120.00} in my savings account	1
and they have the WRONG number.	1
and they havenot done so. Please have them list this date as soon as you receive my complaint.	1
and they hemmed and hawed and could n't provide an answer. I believe they are trying to keep the account open so they can collect the annual fee. They have wasted 2 hours of my time on this matter. I believe they should warn consumers that this is a distinct possibility and the government should consider not letting Citibank issue credit cards.	1
and they informed me ( Exhibit D ) that XXXX claims this account still to be in collection. Further RPMhas called me and was extremely belligerent when I attempted to explain that the debt had been settled and threatened that I would be subject to further action.	1
and they informed me of the mortgage being sold. This was fine	1
and they informed me that I have done everything to qualify for the offer but do n't know why I have n't received it. They told me I had to put a ticket in with their marketing department and it would take 4-6 weeks to resolve. Discover Bank seems to be taking an excessive amount of time to post deposits to make interest off of the "" float. '' In addition	1
and they informed me that their billing had simply not caught up to their emails	1
and they just have the same answer every time.	1
and they just tell me I owe it and that is it. I asked them why this is the first time I am hearing about this	1
and they know I am they wrong person and should not call me. I also want them punished to the fullest extent of the law.	1
and they lowered my balance below what I had charged. This change in my balanced cost my payment to change from {$25.00} to {$30.00}. When I received my next bill	1
and they mail me some frivolous papers	1
and they must be removed from the report.	1
and they never attempted to receive an acknowledgement or confirmation from me. After complaining	1
and they never call me regardless of when I pay. This second XXXX was n't refinanced and is the original loan. They are both on the same servicing website XXXX It makes no sense and is very offensive. Please help until I can refinance and dump them. The actual loan rate is fine. It is just their utter disrespect and incompetence I ca n't stand. Since when does a company start collections on someone every month and insult someone who chose to keep them when they refinanced? Had I known	1
and they never provide it. Please help to resolve it.	1
and they put the item on PayPal Credit. I then was charged a late fee	1
and they refuse to give out that person 's direct extension phone number as well. They will only provide a first name of who is supposedly reviewing our paperwork and a fax number. Then when I request to speak with a supervisor they refuse to provide the supervisor 's name or extension they only transfer you to a voicemail. I do n't feel they are acting in good faith on our request and are engaging in fraudulent lending practices.	1
and they refused to provide any explanation.	1
and they refused.	1
and they removed XXXX of the accounts but XXXX remained. I have been contacting them and calling them to no avail. I feel completely defrauded and my rights were violated. Their only interest was collecting the money. They have destroyed my credit and have caused me to loose out on credit being extended to me. I want them to fulfill the promise made to me as I followed thru on my promise and paid them in full. The agency in question is called MID Michigan Collection Agency in XXXX XXXX Michigan ( email XXXXXXXXXXXX ). Their phone number is XXXX. Please help! I feel so victimized. I have sent letters to the Michigan State Attorney General as well as the FTC. I also understand that they broke the law by even promising a pay for delete so now it makes sense to me why they are bailing out and refusing to go further with my accounts. So many laws were broken here.	1
and they reported that my account began with them on XXXX/XXXX/12 and was derogatory. They continue to show this on all credit bureaus despite the fact that I 've contested it and shown them that they did not even have servicing at any time.	1
and they said "" you have to call back and tell us that and we can not remove this late charge now because you did n't call us back to tell us the date you were paying. ''	1
and they said I had been processed to a new offer. They did not make this clear to me anywhere	1
and they said I still owe them {$11000.00}. At this rate I will never pay them off. I have tried to refinance my mortgage but because of the lien from XXXX Bank and the debt collector 's refusal to subordinate	1
and they said I still owe them {$11000.00}. At this rate I will never pay them off. I have tried to refinance my mortgage but because of the lien from XXXX XXXX and the debt collector 's refusal to subordinate	1
and they said I was missing a payment then	1
and they said no	1
and they said no. I would be required to fax in my request. It 's been more than 2 months and I still have not received my payments refunded to me. I know the servicer has a fiduciary responsibility to apply payments	1
and they said their is a statue of limitations. If the consumer is suppose to follow the status of limitations rule	1
and they said they could n't do anything about it and they would report it to the credit bureau by XXXX XXXX	1
and they said they could not tell me my new minimum. So they are making it impossible for me to plan at all.	1
and they said they did not get it. Finally XXXX took on the battle and I received some credit. However	1
and they said they did. I asked when they would be mailing me my next statement and was told on XXXX XXXX. I told them I believe I 'm supposed to get the statement prior to XX/XX/XXXX and I asked to have legal council call me. I was put on hold and I eventually hung up. I do n't believe they know what the laws are and I want to receive my statement on time.	1
and they said they have not had direction from the lender. I filed BK in XX/XX/XXXX and as a result	1
and they said they would	1
and they said this was NOT true. Initiation of an Escrow Account for late taxes	1
and they seem to be doing this to many other people. I believe it is a scheme to defraud people out of money they do not owe. There is other misconduct Seterus is committing. If you run a search on the Internet for Seterus Inc.	1
and they sent me a check in that amount. I was told to send this check back to Seterus. from an agent from Seterus who told me to send this check to an address in XXXX Co. I was told later that was an incorrect address. I wrote on this check for Escrow Account only!!!!! since my escrow account had a minus amount at that time due to this payment to XXXX XXXX. Then this check was wrongfully put on my loan balance. I have continued to make calls to Seterus to try to get this issued resolved. They give me the run-around	1
and they should take it more seriously.	1
and they signed for it on XXXX XXXX 2015. I still never received a response.	1
and they sold it to enhanced recovery where i settled and paid my debt	1
and they sounded suspicious. Sometimes they call every day	1
and they started foreclosing on me in three months	1
and they state that they need to speak to the Homeowner. We get the Homeowner to call	1
and they state they do n't send me statements. This is not accurate. After speaking with the representative XX/XX/XXXX	1
and they stated because the payment was late & I had n't reached back out to them directly in a timely-fashion. Ironically	1
and they stated that it would take XXXX days. It took XXXX months. During that time	1
and they stated that they do not furnish that information to anyone. They suggested I contact my attorney again ( who never had luck getting the paperwork either ). This is preventing us from having our on time mortgage payments listed on our credit report and is holding up our attempts to refinance our home. We have paid on time every month since the bankruptcy discharge XX/XX/XXXX and our credit reports do not reflect this positive payment history as a result of Chase 's unwillingness to provide necessary documentation.	1
and they stated to me that nothing shows up in their records under my social. I mentioned to them that that is exactly the reason why I am calling and that they need to fix the mistake they made. I mentioned to them that there is no reason why I should be taking a hit on my credit if they have absolutely no information about me. I told them that the same information that they used to cause the damage is the same information they need to use to fix the mistake. They stated to me that they are unable to do that and that I need to send them a certified letter. And there is no telling if they will even budge after receiving the certified letter. I feel as though it is n't right that I must shoot through hoops and ladders to have something removed that I never owed to begin with. Why must I have to spend additional money to prove that such and such debt is not mine? From what I was aware of I thought that when attempting to ruin lives they have to make sure that ALL OF THE INFORMATION MATCHES - NOT JUST SOME. There is no record using my social that I owe this debt and several other debts ; because it is not just one that I am being penalized for. But my credit is the one taking all of the damages. This is really affecting not only myself but my wife as well. The goals that we are trying to accomplish is taking a back seat because we have been trying to resolve these unnecessary issues first. And to make matters worse we do not know what the end result will be. I thought it required more than someone 's first and last name and possibly their address to attach a debt to them? I do not understand why I should have to go through any of this.	1
and they still did n't fix the problem. Should I sue the credit card company for damage?	1
and they still show that I owe XXXX and were planning on withdrawing from my account on the XXXX. I have added up the total amount they withdrew since XXXX/XXXX/15 and the total amount was XXXX. That is well enough to cover the XXXX. I called and asked about my loan	1
and they still told me other wise. There are too many major things wrong with the way things are on my property and loan. On XXXX XXXX	1
and they stole my automobile. I then asked them to provide me with a contract or documents stating that I owed them money	1
and they tell me that there is no way to remove them even though I was assured they would n't be charged in the first place. I took screenshots of the final chat I had with this company	1
and they tell me that they never ordered the Stop Payment	1
and they then started foreclosure proceedings and refused any of my payments as per their letter dated XXXX XXXX	1
and they told me Delaware Solutions is not a licensed collection agency	1
and they told me I had paid everything and was current on my account ( I still have phones with them ). I received a XXXX call on XX/XX/XXXX stating that if I did not pay the {$99.00} it would go on my credit bureau. I asked again for them to send a bill. She said she sent it to an address I 've never had	1
and they told me I now owed them {$65.00} by XXXX XXXX. They ( now speaking with a manager ) said that they wo n't refund the XXXX late fee until that amount is paid in full	1
and they told me my account was closed.	1
and they told me my home insurance and property taxes went down. They said on the phone "" This cant be right '' Asked for a supervisor or someone from their escrow department to contact me. I have spoken to XXXX of their customer service reps	1
and they told me that I only had until XX/XX/XXXX to do it. They received the money on XX/XX/XXXX and told me that "" there was nothing we can do. '' First of all	1
and they told me that they do not hold any funds ever	1
and they told me the same thing again. I ca n't fight with XXXX because there 's nothing to fight about	1
and they told me the steps I needed to take in order to have the inquiry removed. I forwarded that info over to the mortgage broker so he could rectify his unethical mistake. He said he would take care of the problem and acknowledged that he was wrong. After some back and forth correspondence he said he spoke with his boss and was told there was n't anything he could do because he did n't want to be in any trouble. I have n't heard from the mortgage broker at all and he refuses to answer my calls. Please help	1
and they told me they are reporting to Equifax and the other XXXX credit bureaus that this account is closed. I am attaching supporting documentation this time to my complaint from XXXX XXXX that keeps showing this collection as an open collection. I was recently denied credit by several companies for an auto loan because of this open collection reporting to them when they pulled my credit report as well. This collection account reporting as open instead of as closed is negatively impacting my credit score even though it is a XXXX balance. An open collection harms my credit score more than a closed collection. If this complaint is not resolved this time	1
and they told me they would release my money in 6 months. While I was extremely unhappy about them essentially stealing my money for 6 months	1
and they turned it down because they could not authenticate my identity. Specifically	1
and they walked off with XXXX. I expect to declare chapter XXXX as a result of their usury	1
and they want to take my property!!! All of a sudden have changed the monthly mortgage amount unbeknownst to me	1
and they wanted a revised termite inspection because termite remediation was waived because it was not active	1
and they went into in school deferment	1
and they were moving forward with the account. I was stunned I explained that I had already done this and he said he had no record of it. I told him it would take me until this evening to get my emails and pictures compiled and sent. He then again tells me it would n't matter as my dispute was not valid. I did some research and have found this and the fact that they are supposed to look at my dispute. If i am disputing they have to give me a chance. They are not i am just being told over and over by him that I DO NOT have any option but to pay or have my account "" move forward '' -even though he could n't tell me what that meant when specifically asking. This was very sad an frustrating here i am thinking I am going to be sued over something I do not in fact owe. Yet he is telling me I have no recourse. I need help. They gave me a file number which i can provide if needed.	1
and they will not pay my 5%.  I contacted the merchant	1
and they will not provide me with this verification. The reporting agencies and XXXX XXXX refuse to remove the account from my report and my next step is legal action	1
and they will not tell us what the fees are for. All we want to do is pay the money and keep our house	1
and they withdraw twice on XXXX XXXX. Called on XXXX at XXXX XXXX	1
and they would look to continue with the original modification we had with XXXX XXXX. We asked XXXX to put it in writing	1
and theyhave not done so. Please have them list this date as soon as you receive my complaint.	1
and this balance was paid off with XXXX payments. Most interesting was that Bloomingdales did not even have the address that I moved from	1
and this could 've altered my decision to accept an extension on monthly payments that I fell behind on. Therefore	1
and this debt was Identity theft file with XXXX. This practice is unethical also illegal	1
and this does not help her FICO score! With Chase nor the credit bureau willing to help	1
and this has adversely affected our credit rating.	1
and this has finally been recognized on my credit report	1
and this has not happened. What is happening is that they are clearing in violation of the FDCPA.	1
and this is documented in our file. All of our co-signers are retired	1
and this is financial abuse. Please let me know as soon as possible if anyone can help me. This is a very unusual situation	1
and this is of course this is affecting my life negatively because I am a single mother and I would really appreciate your help in this case. I thank you for anything you can do to help me.	1
and this must stop or I will need to seek legal civil litigation.	1
and this new company ( considering it 's my XXXX mortgage ) is not willing to do any modifications and I do n't qualify for the harp program. My question is if I started off modifying both loans with Chase why is it that they decided to sell off the smaller loan	1
and this only escalated the rudeness and hostility from the loan officer. When asking questions and highlighting things that are questionable fees ( I only received a fee sheet after going to the corporate office ) I do not expect the company to make the situation more hostile. The executive my wife talked to said the fees were only estimates and I would find out the true costs in the HUD-1. This is deceptive because at the time you see the HUD-1 you have no time left to rebut them without delaying the buying a process. In addition they have failed to update the VA with information during the appraisal process which is now pushing the loans past the closing date ( we can not get the lender to give us any information about it and the VA has n't gotten a response from the lender in over a week since their last request ). The loan officer failed to lock in the rate for the loan and it increased over that 2 week period. Since we complained about the fees we have only been brushed off by the company and talking to them only makes the situation worse. I assume they are trying to tank the loan process so they can still receive the application fees while not having to fulfill the loan after the complaints. If we lose the house because of delays we will lose about {$3000.00} in fees. Every day past XXXX XXXX is costing us to store household goods and temporary living expenses until we can find a permanent residence.	1
and this placement of insurance has messed up the escrow account	1
and this was cleared up and supposedly rescinded as this was their mistake- we made all of our payments and provided proof. We continued to make payments and again they are saying they did not receive payments for XXXX and XXXX although they have attached proof. Our account manager	1
and this year they have the amount wrong. They have two payments of {$1400.00} for county taxes when it is suppose to be {$1500.00}. Their one job is to manage my escrow account and pay my taxes and hazard insurance	1
and thought I was making a practical financial decision. I am not attempting to shirk my responsibility	1
and thought it was taken care of on XXXX XXXX	1
and threatened to sue me over a disputed credit card debt the collection of which is barred by the statute of limitations. ARA Inc employees have been very abusive	1
and threatening. He 's lied to us and bullied us every time we speak on the phone. He refuses to send documents and his only response is "" This is n't about me	1
and through sheer luck noticed a small link at the bottom right	1
and thus	1
and thus -is the only one who has standing to participate in foreclosure proceedings.	1
and thus I never even knew a bill was supposedly due. Fast forward till now. I do a credit report and find out that my credit is tainted	1
and thus deny me access to my report and ability to dispute items. They have an address listed I do not reside	1
and tile for my home. ( {$2000.00} pr month ) They are refusing to give me the 3 % stating that the point of purchase	1
and to "" next '' month 's interest. In XXXX cases	1
and to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. The first XXXX were unsecured loans	1
and to be paid in XXXX monthly installments. I paid off this mortgage on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. After checking my payments I noticed that the interest I have being paying is 8.02	1
and to be so harassing	1
and to buy groceries for my family. I had explain everything in detail to the individuals at Wells Fargo why my payments were late	1
and to continue making payments as I had been for XXXX years. At that time	1
and to date	1
and to date - Equifax has failed to comply.	1
and to determine the remaining arrearage. I have paid in excess of {$200.00} over the balance they stated as evidenced by online banking however my arrearage is not closed and no one at Seterus can provide me answers. I 've asked for a breakdown as to how they have applied the payments numerous times and still have not received anything.	1
and to discuss a buy out option on mine at the end of the term. I agreed. It was a verbal agreement via phone. Nothing was signed. I payed them {$500.00} at the time of the agreement XX/XX/XXXX	1
and to expect to see the card within 2-3 weeks. I called again on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX as I had not gotten my card and was told that the dispute was pending until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX! How was the dispute found in my favor on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when it was supposedly pending until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX? U.S.Bank has very shady and deceptive practices on refunding customers for fraudulent charges	1
and to explain the ambiguous terms of the Borrowers ' Line of Credit with Wells Fargo which do not support the estimated finance charge of 5.425 % during the repayment period for the subject Line of Credit. In this respect	1
and to keep my good credit rating. I assumed my tenant would move out	1
and to keep up a house I can not sell because of Flagstar 's Negligence. Also	1
and to market the property for sale by XX/XX/2015. We were granted a 90 day extension on XXXX XXXX. Due to miscommunication between Realtor and Trustee	1
and to my knowledge I do n't owe any one.	1
and to my surprise a hooka pen. I do n't smoke XXXX. It cracked the plastic casing and the dealer had someone close it due to winter arriving and the peace that fell off should have been replaced. I started to make complaints regarding these issues .but nothing was done. Also it took a while but I did end up finding the lean holder and thinking that they were true to their mission statement I started to explain what was going on and the amount loaned was too much then my down payment seem to be something that would haunt me in this future. I explained that the car was having issues and also that I was extremely happy to find out who my Leander was because no one explained a thing to me. They did n't even know the small suv had an automatic starter till I expressed to XXXX XXXX. I was also very expressive regarding the machine in the car which could cause all types of strenuous issues especially for a person such as myself. Well long story short I 'm in XXXX and will on a journey to assist the fraud this company has done	1
and to now find out all my monies went into their pocket. Thank you. XXXX	1
and to promise protection from a loss of greater than 10 % and yet I suffered losses of 40 % below the market. The response I 'm getting from Raymond James is not acceptable when they are supposed to stand behind their promise of protection and integrity. They empathize with my situation but say the trades were valid trades even though the orders were filled at prices lower than the sop amount limit was set for.	1
and to prove my address	1
and to see how it would work	1
and to stop any overage charges or attempts. They say sure	1
and today sent me back to AMEX customer service without asking permission when I protested their response. The response they give is very different than what AMEX customer service gives me. While customer service assures me I am in good standing	1
and told her I have told her more than once not to call my work phone. She said it was system generated and she had no control over it. I told her I never even gave them the place where I worked	1
and told him that they were going to repossess the vehicle if I did not pay on the account. We scheduled another meeting with XXXX and went in to discuss the loan and what happened regarding the contact with my brother. She said that they determined that the person who made this call was terminated as they found that she had done several other things that were not permitted. At this point	1
and told him that we are pieces of XXXX. A different person calls me each time and from different phone numbers. They have stated my debt is 1 to 2 thousand more dollars then it actually is. They are harassing me	1
and told me I had to make pay all past due amounts at once. This included a check they cashed but put into holding	1
and told me that the only available way they would assist me is TTY	1
and told me there would be no charge for a warranty replacement. After that	1
and told me to call again. So I called again and they again denied that I owed anything. So I called the firm again and they agreed that they would look further into my case. When I called them back they said that it was a mistake and that they would take it off of my credit Report. It has been about a month and a half and it has not been the case.	1
and told me to go out the door to the car. I had no way of knowing at that time that XXXX had inserted erroneous	1
and told me to go to Advance America and pay now	1
and told my sister-in-law that they were going to serve my company legal documents subpoenaing me to court. I have contacted the company and asked for a cease and desist order for this debt and asked that they cease all harassing phone calls containing false statements.	1
and told that of the {$1100.00} a month I recieve I owe {$1000.00} a month in bills	1
and told that the cashiers check was made out to the wrong company and that I need to wire money to them. I immediately thought this was a scam	1
and told that they could not provide the information I am requestion. My principal is only gettitng {$94.00} dollars paid towards it and almost {$400.00} toward interest. How is thios possible	1
and told the representative about call # XXXX	1
and told them I was no longer the owner so that my policy would be cancelled and suntrust could bilk me for an outrageous insurance binder thereby increasing what I owe	1
and told them I was sending the trial plan payment	1
and told them that i feel that i am going to have issues with this company and to please cancel my debit card all together	1
and told themthat I wanted to move to a bi-weekly payment schedule so that I couldpay down my mortgage more quickly. The customer service rep confirmed that by making the switch	1
and took action to enroll in text alerts in regards to payment due date. To this day I receive absolutely no mobile alerts in regards to my account	1
and took it over to deposit in the account at Chase Bank	1
and transportation. I could not take a direct loan out mid-semester so I was forced to take a private loan to continue my education. I took out a {$15000.00} loan that is through American Educational Services. I did not know that this loan would not be eligible for the XXXX forgiveness program.	1
and trapping consumers in deals that fail to live up to the promises made and what consumers are offered. I was caught off guard with these interest fees that should not have began until XX/XX/XXXX at least.	1
and treated me as sub-human.	1
and treated poorly. I attempted to block their calls	1
and tried to pay them in full	1
and tried to take the truck back on XXXX differant accations. The lease came throw	1
and ttheir most recent submission to the credit agencies should reflect that my account has been current.	1
and turn around and open a new account in XX/XX/2010 when I already had an account?!	1
and twice on XXXX. I went into the bank to get these overdraft charges reversed and was told something new	1
and two weeks they repo the vehicle and they are not responding to my inquiries. I 'm afraid they are going to ruing my credit score and not going to remove this from my credit	1
and ultimately has had an enormous impact on my young financial life. There is no option to finance a car	1
and unemployment records to the attorney assigned to the case by America 's Servicing Company. I did this as requested sending the documents through the mail certified to the attorney 's office by the date specified in XXXX 2014. After this I heard nothing from the mortgage company or attorney for several months. In XXXX 2014	1
and unfair debt collection practices used by many debt collectors.	4
and unhelpful.	1
and us having to pay {$210.00} on a monthly basis to keep from losing it	1
and using strong-arm tactics to collect.	1
and usually I am not at a place to receive the new ATM card as I travel.	1
and utility bills.but even when I did this I was told I couldnt and wouldnt be look at for the program. It is my understanding that the reentry team has hard decline my file in an attempt not to allow it to be looked at again. I have had a modification in the past and it still didnt help my affordability so I applied for another XXXX and now they give me the reason because I have a XXXX loan and it was originated after XX/XX/XXXX that I dont qualify for any programs. Then on the very next day XXXX XXXX I receive a letter in the mail saying that I was turn down from assistance because there wasnt a sufficient change in circumstance but the fact is that my circumstance was never reviewed because upon asking for other documents to place in the review process I had already been turned down by this department so noone ever looked to see if my circumstance had truely changed which it did. The big issue is that if fannie mae doesnt have a program for me because of my origination date then it doesnt matter if I make XXXX times or XXXX times the payment I would never qualify and this all would have been a complete waist but this doesnt seem tru because as I stated before Ive gotten a modification before so whats really going on. So there are truely unexplained situations	1
and various debit charges totaling {$180.00}. According to my account view	1
and verified with them that I was paid in full	1
and vertification method.	1
and very accommodating. With XXXX	1
and via certified letters sent to Unifund and their attorney XXXX based out of XXXX XXXX	1
and via email. I was attempting to find out how to submit a power of attorney from my client so that I could determine what was happening with her account	1
and violated my rights and lied to me. Every time I called them the message said the did n't want to speak to me and sent me somewhere else ... I 've been very much fed up with them and I was treated like an animal..I have reported them to the XXXX..and would like action taking against these people	1
and violation of federal laws	1
and voice mails.	1
and void ( not voidable ) from the beginning at the closing table. Simply signing disputed documents does not constitute a "" consumated TILA transaction. Additionally	1
and warned me to not pay.	1
and was again ( for the XXXX or XXXX time ) requesting documentation for the loan modification process. I had set up bi-weekly phone calls to speak with my account rep and would speak with the rep when they called. The last XXXX times I spoke with the account rep	1
and was approved for the trial modification period. I asked what the terms of the modification were	1
and was assigned to a Relationship Manager. A few weeks later I received a call from my Relationship Manager requesting additional documentation to process my request for assistance. According to the Relationship Manager	1
and was dismayed when	1
and was forwarded to a machine to leave my name and contact number. I did that	2
and was given reassurance that a later date would be arranged	1
and was going to close the account	1
and was hung up on 3 times during the 7 hours I spent on the telephone with the credit union. No one would accept my payment for the account	1
and was informed that someone will be calling me back. I have not received a returned call to this date. The account was updated without Santander providing any proof that the account is actually mine	1
and was instead enrolled in PayPal Credit. There was no e-mail or notification that this was done	1
and was lied to	1
and was named XXXX team for maintaining the highest GPA on the team for two years straight. During the three years in which I handled my own financial aid I was advised by XXXX XXXX XXXX 's financial aid office to go to XXXX and to take out Signature Student Loans in order to cover the remaining costs that I had during the year. It was so easy and I had no idea what I was getting in to. Before I knew it I was {$100000.00} in debt to XXXX XXXX ( now Navient ) with 9.75 % and 9.25 % interest rates and very little hope for a financial future. Monthly payments have been over {$1000.00}. I work a full-time job	1
and was not acceptable even if closure would not happen until XXXX. This was not in alignment with what I was originally told. The rate lock then expired and another loan was originated in XXXX. This loan then sat waiting for "" pricing exemptions '' and other rate adjustments that the loan officer was trying to push through to match the original terms from the 1st origination. This then lead to another expiration of the rate lock. Now	1
and was not removed as promised. Therefore the agency gave me false statements in order to collect a debt. The agency in question is Bureau of Medical Economics on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
and was placed on hold for 2 hours. By then the office was shut for the day. I tried again on XXXX in the morning	1
and was placed on hold for XXXX minutes before being told by a "" XXXX ''	1
and was recently informed by a loan officer while trying to purchase a home	1
and was refused. The Citi Cards representative did not resolve the matter to my satisfaction.	1
and was shut down ( I had not received any notice prior to this moment - by email	1
and was subject to illegal mortgage practices by XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX prior to recession	1
and was subsequently charged another {$5.00} on XXXX/XXXX/15. Based on my chat session on XXXX/XXXX/15	1
and was told I would receive a return call due to volume. I received the call from XXXX at XXXX PT. I explained that the charge from XXXX for {$130.00} and XXXX for {$130.00} were not mine. I was told that the account would be closed and a new card would be sent to me XXXX	1
and was told by XXXX XXXX of Quicken Loans that they had 'permissible purpose ' if they had my social security number and date of birth. I told them that if anyone had my info they still needed my approval to do anything with it	1
and was told by branch staff that "" it would no doubt be caught tomorrow morning when we get our accounts reconciliation for today 's activities. '' This {$100.00} overage was caught and noted by those same Branch staff	1
and was told it can take 7-10 more days and I would need to wait. I did	1
and was told it was resolved ( They received it early	1
and was told that I could file an appeal. The gentleman gave me a number to call so I could start this process. Ironically	1
and was told that notifications of the bill were sent in XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. This was four years ago	1
and was told that the Credit Memo was time specific and as of today	1
and was told the complaint department is the only place that can assist with this information I understand they are required to supply.	1
and was told the document was faxed to me on XXXX XXXX	1
and was told the problem would be fixed. It has been 8 months now	1
and was told the same thing. Once again	1
and was told to contact the merchant. XXXX XXXX	1
and was told to go purchase another prepaid card of any type. I called them back and gave them the card numbers and I was told they were not compatible that I needed to go purchase a specific card! I called back and asked to speak to another supervisor. He told me that I had to wait for another 4 hours. At this point I believe they are operating under a scam. Blackhawk Network is the owner of this operation. They do n't answer their phone. XXXX.	1
and was transferred to another collection agency	1
and was trying to hurry off the phone.	1
and was unable to access my account. Consequently	1
and was unsuccessful and I have contacted U.S. Bank directly and was unsuccessful. I am just trying to understand what is going on and how I am liable for a bounced check that could never clear when it was someone else 's check ....	1
and wasted my time and other	3
and wave the {$95.00} fee for the first year	1
and we always say we are on a modification plan and we are current	1
and we apologize for the inconvenience.	1
and we are not in arrears on any debt. At XXXX years old	1
and we are paying almost XXXX percent down. The reason for our decline is that Quicken is stating they will not do a loan for a XXXX employed person moving out of XXXX. This is quite a statement coming from a company who markets all over the United States. I can do business in XXXX or any State from any location. Our company has the tools to use the internet to conduct our business without having to meet face to face. My wife and I have been discriminated against based on a XXXX employment income. We have a ten thousand dollar deposit on the house and may very well lose that deposit.	1
and we are still stuck with an underwater mortgage at this usurious rate. We can not refinance because the market has not come back. We owe {$250000.00}	1
and we ca n't choose Chase over our children. I called Chase Bank to let them know the situation and to see if I could make a few smaller payments to get caught up again. I had also called them prior to the missed payment letting them know I may not be able to pay if we could n't get a renter in place in time. They said they could n't help unless I was 90 days late and would n't even talk to me about any options. After I missed the XXXX payment	1
and we closed on our house on XXXX XXXX	1
and we did not foresee the complications this would cause me. I have been trying to get my name substituted in on the mortgage	1
and we do not trust that they will fulfill their contractual responsibilities to close out our fully paid mortgage.	1
and we ended up in court on XX/XX/XXXX instead of mediation which is what I was promised since the very beginning	1
and we finally closed XXXX/XXXX/15. Nearly five months after we were told it would take place.	1
and we forward the email to mastercard dispute dept. During that time	1
and we had a home invasion in XX/XX/XXXX and theft the day we moved out. Plus financially we could not afford to keep the house which is the hardship we claimed on the shot sale. We vacated the house in XX/XX/XXXX to aid in the house being shown and move in ready. The reason for the denial was my credit score was above XXXX and that is the only reason given. We listed the house immediately in XX/XX/XXXX We had XXXX showings	1
and we had a three way phone call with my poor mom. The Teller	1
and we had already arranged for payment in full to be withdrawn from our bank account prior to the closing date on the American Express account as is and had been our custom with American Express over many years	1
and we have documentation of all emails sent and received.	1
and we have documentation. Looking for help with legal issues to sue.	1
and we have gone over my loan-payment history	1
and we have never been late with our mortgage payments. We 've been contacting Wells Fargo 's customer service and they keep delaying the correction process because of their investigations of their internal issue. My credit report was perfect before this Wells Fargo 's errors	1
and we have seen no further fraudulent activity on these accounts.	1
and we needed to relocate for my husband 's job across the country. I had a baby. I needed to stay home for a while. With both loan providers	1
and we never knew the bank did n't foreclose on us	1
and we provided all the required information with no delay. Loan officer assured us that we are all set with the application and we need to pay the appraisal fee in the amount of {$470.00}. The appraisal report came after one week	1
and we scanned it into the VA. I went directly to XXXX from XXXX XXXX. While XXXX	1
and we sent them again. On XXXX/XXXX/15 he stated in an email he got all pages. We sent several emails asking for a status update. On XXXX/XXXX/15 he stated in an email that the processor will have documents to us by end of XXXX. We sent emails the end of XXXX asking the status as we received nothing from the. On XXXX/XXXX/15 he called our home and stated that they were waiting for us to send the Deed of Trust! He was reminded of all the above information and after arguments he "" checked with his processor '' and said we would have documents by XXXX. We asked for that in writing and also to speak with his supervisor XXXX XXXX. XXXX never did return a phone call and neither XXXX nor XXXX have returned multiple requests for a status update. They have had our money since XXXX. All we are asking is to have our loan recast. Their incompetence and lack of response and follow up is frustrating and unnecessary. It is difficult to speak with XXXX and each interaction leaves us frustrated and upset. Please help.	1
and we sent them information to begin the process on XXXX XXXX.	1
and we still have received the clear-to-close from the bank.	1
and we were falling behind. This was a year ago mind you. Every time we sent the documents they claimed they did not have enough information and documents	1
and we were lied to over and over again	1
and we were pre-approved to borrow XXXX percent of a purchase price up to {$410000.00} ( loan amount up to {$420000.00}. ) Based on that representation	1
and we were unable to sell or refinance. We have been working hard to make our payments for the last eight ( 8 ) years to keep our home in spite of our many troubles and have kept our credit score in the XXXX to XXXX range.	1
and wells fargo stole {$17.00} from me. I asked the manager to either reverse the charge or reimburse me to fix the situation.	1
and went on a shopping spree. I never knew about it ( because I never received any statements ) until I got the calls from the collection agency. They were so disruptive that I ended up paying the debt to the collection agency ( see attached )	1
and were "" approved '' for a loan modification thru Bayview Loan Servicing. We have paid them {$2900.00}. We have been trying to get Bayview to correct our address. We live in DE	1
and were given preliminary approval. On XXXX XXXX	1
and were sent a letter dated XXXX XXXX stating we needed to provide proof of insurance	1
and were told by supervisor XXXX XXXX that all of the charges would be reversed	1
and were told that that would probably not happen because we had about 30 days before the scheduled foreclosure. We asked to give it a try as we believe a short sale is more advantageous to both parties. After speaking to several representatives at different times and days	1
and were told we do not know the XXXX party. I believe the call from this company and the other calls are connected	1
and what bank would loan them money for a home that was n't worth the asking price? I truly do n't understand and feel XXXX XXXX is taking advantage of the situation. I have a buyer	1
and what if any giving information to any other entity. What other companies have a hold on this debt	1
and what kind of activity has been going on. Please help me.	1
and what month will be paid but the company is not cooperating. Please help me if you can to let this company send me a bill with details or itemized what month I owed them. Thank you.	1
and what the money will be used for. At XXXX I refused to be forthcoming with that information as it was no one 's business. Frankly	1
and whatever criteria they are using to make these decisions is discriminatory.	1
and whatever third party this doctor knew about	1
and when I advised it would probably be until XX/XX/XXXX for sure before I could resume payments	1
and when I asked for them to produce evidence of said debt	1
and when I asked her where she had sent it	1
and when I call they just give me another # that does n't work. They receive my payment checks but seem to disregard the paperwork about the PMI cancellation. Their lack of professionalism has cost my family hundreds so far.	1
and when I call to request a stop to the calls I am told they can only provide temporary relief. I am also told I may not speak to a manager	1
and when I called PNC the manager I spoke with even admitted my payments from the previous year ( XX/XX/XXXX ) were identical to this current year- yet she still said it was their right to change my premium ( although in the last 5 years on either XXXX of my homes	1
and when I called in after faxing the information to the company	1
and when I called them	1
and when I called to verify the payment was made	1
and when I contacted Midland Funding those documents miraculously showed up on XXXX XXXX	1
and when I contacted XXXX XXXX those documents miraculously showed up on XXXX XXXX	1
and when I do	1
and when I filed my taxes they took my state return. I assumed since I was n't getting returns that they were still taking them	1
and when I finally did get through no one could help me at all in fact the representative seemed to be in the dark as much as I am. Fast forward it has now been 10 days of the same thing	1
and when I gave up and tried to do a short sale we ran into a brick wall as well. We need you to investigate their servicing practices and accounting practices.	1
and when I saw the money in there	1
and when I saw the remainder on the small XXXX was XXXX I then gave her cash to pay that off. I told her I would be back in XX/XX/XXXX and she agreed. Then three days later I got a call that I owed te bad check and fee when I had just paid it. I advised tee to have XXXX call me. She left a voicemail I tried three days to call back but she was always in lunch as I am only call at lunch when I am not having a business lunch. We played phone tag. After two weeks of working solid teaching classes I called and tee said I owed XXXX my payment on the account not paid was around XXXX. Tee said I owed the bad check	1
and when I told them they ca n't do that without taking me to court and proving the validity of the debt	1
and when I tried to make sure they had the correct address	1
and when I went back to my property	1
and when I went to reset my password	1
and when i complained	1
and when it came time to finalize the documentation	1
and when it does n't show up after that time frame they have to put a stop pay ( another 7-10 business days ) and then they can send out which could take another two weeks. I still have not received a call back as promised or anything regarding my refund check. I 've asked several people to speak to a manager but apparently there is only XXXX manager who takes calls and she is always busy and does not return phone calls. I honestly feel like they are not going to send my check back at all and I am not sure what do to anymore. I would have NEVER acquired a loan from them if I knew it was going to be anything like this. Do not do business with these people!	1
and when my loan officer calculated my payments	1
and when obviously it is n't kept they note it as a broken promise and pretty much throw it in your face and against you. I 've expressed my apology to failure keeping my loan on track when i understand i commited myself to it	1
and when the collection company filed a civil suit against me XX/XX/XXXX he signed for and subsequently misplaced the summons. Discovered the summons in a pile of papers while helping clean his house	1
and when you call them out on their extremely unethical practices they can provide no explanation to why these hidden fees were not communicated. I am contacting my attorney and the XXXX regarding these unethical business practices.	1
and which BOA confirmed to me would be DELIVERED on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX respectively. I accepted this arrangement even though this same situation happened six months earlier as well. The XXXX policy was indeed DELIVERED Electronically on XXXX XXXX to the Insurance company. Today	1
and which Citibank	1
and which continues to be pursued by US Bank which largely just got rid of regulatory issues with CFPB and FTC falsely claiming to have dropped the dispute. At this point	1
and which is not due until XXXX XXXX. I have never been dunned for amount for which I have not been billed. This is beyond bad customer service ; I believe that it constitutes harassment	1
and which they accept that payments up until XX/XX/XXXX. They sent me a letter stating they cant accept my payments anymore or not applied to my mortgage so I ask them where my payments went? they put those payments of mine in the fund. Since then I have been fighting struggling and handling their harassment that makes me sick and XXXX	1
and while on the phone with the representative asked to correct the issue so that my autopay made the minimum payment due by the due date. This change was made by the representative while we were on the phone.	1
and while we were on the phone	1
and who knows what happens to a credit score during this process	1
and who the person was that the check originated from. The representative then went on to explain that the account was too new and that BOA had a right to cancel my accounts at their own discretion. She then told me that I should immediately STOP my direct deposit from coming to the accounts because I would n't have access to it. Because of BOA closed the account the final balance reflected a negative balance because of the returned funds. I did n't find out about the negative balance until months later. It reflects that I owed BOA {$130.00}. It was discovered while trying to open another bank account to handle my commerce. It has been 3 plus years and to my amazement after trying to open an account at XXXX XXXX	1
and why did n't they take the XXXX {$230.00} from my savings account and not my checking	1
and why is there so much incompetence? XXXX said that I should be getting this removed and a confirmation letter in a few days all I got out of them was XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX	1
and will be covered by a Homeowners policy which names the BB & T mortgage as being covered. This policy is paid by an automatic draft on my BB & T checking account and is and has been up-to-date. I contacted BB & T on XXXX XX/XX/2015 to inform them of their error and give them complete details of my insurance coverage of my mortgage ; and a follow up on XX/XX/XXXX2015. I have yet to hear anything from anyone at BB & T.	1
and will be dealing directly with him. Once again	1
and will continue filing complaints with the XXXX as well on this outrageous behavior. No one has bothered to contact me and I 'm sick of complaining and being put on hold	1
and will gladly give detective 's name and number for verification. I 've had previous loans with TITLE MAX that have been settled without problems. I 've always made payments in a timely manner. as matter of fact	1
and will not accept payments to get caught up. I have possessions in the car	1
and will not allow caller to submit identity theft paperwork or police reports to their office. multiple callers will get on the line and shamelessly bash you into the ground.	1
and will not refund the money to complete the flood repairs.	1
and will not remove the account from their files although it was paid in full. Please help me.	1
and with Consumer Relations	1
and with XXXX XXXX	1
and with XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed it was a clerical error	1
and with my taxes going up for the year	1
and with the help of the IRS Advocacy group	1
and within a few days	1
and within the law	1
and within the next week my account was locked as the checks were BOTH reported "" confirmed counterfeit '' by the issuing bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). This was back in XXXX. I called my attorney	1
and without my completing any reaffirmation paperwork. On contrary	1
and without my permission/consent per the e-sign act. I recently became aware that in some cases	1
and wooden kitchen cabinets installed in the amount of {$7800.00}. Again In his own letter XXXX XXXX stated he never completed the job and not all the goods as promised upon by both parties have never been rendered or delivered. Therefore	1
and would continue to do so. She alsoi informed me that the amount of my debt was 2	1
and would like to work more. I have never taken disability or anything	1
and would n't be able to pay an extra {$35.00} on a bill that should be {$25.00}. The rep told me that she ca n't change the bill	1
and would n't return calls or emails. We are now on our XXXX relationship manager. Now	1
and would never say anything so rude. I ca n't access my cheeks or savings accounts. I was told that I had to wait ten days and will get my money as a check in the mail. This has been very difficult on me	1
and would not tell her	1
and would shorten the length of my mortgage. I have tried repeatedly to contact this company to verify that payments were being made to my lender	1
and year after year.	1
and years worth of address history	1
and yesterday XX/XX/XXXX even called my place of employment. I called them back and explained never to call me and to not call my place of employment. The representative was extremely rude and I had difficulty getting them to stop talking so that I could explain that this debt has already been proven invalid but they threatened to report it to the credit agencies again. I asked if I needed to contact the original place that levied this claim and they said no and that it had been "" turned over '' to them. I have already proved I do not owe this money and now they are starting to harass me all over again. I have mailed in my credit reports showing the dismissal of this claim of debt to NCC as of this Monday XXXX XXXX ) so I did provide them written notice that I disagree and that the debt is not valid. I explained all of this on the phone but the representative was loud	1
and yet	1
and yet I received another collection notice which is n't for me. The individual is XXXX whom I do not know. I 'm certain in a 4 month period Arnold Scott Harris	1
and yet another salesman was assembling a pet carrier	1
and yet they	1
and yet they CONTINUE TO HARASS ME VIA PHONE DAILY! I want this STOPPED! I suspect XXXX XXXX has used both my home address/phone no. to fraud those to whom she owes money and probably skipped out owing rent from somewhere	1
and yet they decided to close my account. The worst part is that they are trying to withhold my funds from me within the account ( funds that would put me back financially ). I have asked politely asked them to release the funds to me	1
and yet they have still not removed the fraudulent credit inquiry. I contacted the credit bureau today and was told that only the creditor can remove the inquiry	1
and yet we are now a full week since that time and the Underwriter is showing no urgency at getting back to my file. I am sitting and waiting. I feel that this is an unacceptable way to treat a customer	1
and you accept that as accurate. I must ask	1
and you all had rules in place regarding hiring people.	1
and you can also look at the date they file	1
and you can tell that the creditor did not do their due diligence to verify their identity as they failed in a few obvious areas : verify their previous residence and workplace	1
and you have to pay us {$300.00} a month for the next 3 years	1
and {$10000.00} lower than my LOWEST expectations. I have had both a realtor and a local mortgage broker share with me that they feel I should be appraising at a minimum of {$290000.00}.	1
and {$110000.00} in equity	1
and {$120.00} in fees. However I have had no financial dealings with any such company. Over the summer	2
and {$170.00} on XXXX. Can they legally turn me over to collections when they refused my payment arrangement	1
and {$500.00} for signing up for merchant services within 60 days. For the merchant services account	1
and {$52.00} for a XXXX XXXX account. He kept asking me to buy his XXXX XXXX also	1
and {$64.00}. I was logged into my account via computer and saw the transactions taking place right before my eyes. I immediately contacted USAA Bank so that the transactions would be stopped and my card cancelled. The representative I spoke with contacted XXXX and we found that the charges were taking place in another state. I was told that all the charges to my account would be replaced and I would receive a new card. The following Tuesday I received a new debt card but all the charges were not reversed. The next incident happened on XXXX XXXX with a check from a XXXX and XXXX XXXX being deposited to my account by mobile upload for {$2500.00} at XXXX. I had no knowledge of the transaction taking place. After the mobile deposit series of ATM withdraws took place from XXXX to XXXX for {$100.00}	1
and/or mortgage assistance as prescribed by them ( and on their website ). I was denied a modification because of a previous modification and I was denied a forbearance with no explanation. XXXX options are listed on their website as available resources/options for clients in need of mortgage assistance	1

The Loan Officer had called us for our credit card number to pay for the mortgage fee application and said he was charging the card {$440.00}. He charged our card {$660.00}. Who does this? Is this how Bank of America does business? Our Attorney called us once a week complaining that both Bank of America Officers would not respond to their calls and emails. They put all of us from the very start in a very bad position with this whole process. The burden of their jobs was pushed on us XXXX a week. It was like every day was their first day on the job!

are primarily because of the originator of our mortgage loan was closed down due to fraudulent lending practices 2 years after origination of our mortgage. I have desperately tried to force XXXX and Shellpoint to provide me with a full response to a Qualified Written Request ( QWR ) on several occasions.

I did not ask for the length of time. I asked for you to conduct an investigation and to verify this disputed account. You did no such thing. I reached out to the court to find out your method of verification and I have included their response. The Clerk 's Office affirms they do not provide information to credit reporting agencies. Therefore	1
as I NEVER received anything from them ( I left my forwarding address with the post office. ) I paid this immediately on Monday	1

But on XXXX my account on XXXX website shows that my loan amount is XXXX and that same amount is shown on my XXXX 2015 payment coupon I received in the mail. THIS IS CLEARLY WRONG. On my XXXX statement it shows a XXXX amount and XXXX unapplied funds. My Account on line shows that my next payment is n't due until XXXX 2015	1
as I could n't do it as they have locked me out of the online account. and they said that they could n't because the account was locked and I was never going to get my money back. I said at this point	1

I filed a complaint with the XXXX ( Complaint ID # XXXX XXXX over a month ago and Bloomingdale 's has not responded. It does not seem legal that they refuse to pay me my credit balance on the credit card. It has almost been three months since my first request. They have been paid for the merchandise and have been returned the merchandise	1

as I had n't paid my bill in over 6 months and it was taking a huge toll on my credit score. I had absolutely no idea what she was talking about	1
as I had other purchases to make for the holidays ( in other stores ). I did not think it would be a big deal to wait to pay the last amount next month. Next thing I know I get hit with an interest charge just over {$400.00} on my Best Buy Card. They had sent out a notice before the final payment stating they were going to charge me interest	1
as I had to pay for removal of mattresses that they were supposed to do.

as a matter of fact I think I got the car loan dept. Their phone system is atrocious with many hours wasted on hold only to be at wrong dept and then back on hold to be at wrong dept again and then on hold ... .... I finally went to their office in XXXX and still was not allowed to talk to management although they did set up a video conference with a nice young man who helped me contact fraud dept ( no video there ) where they agreed to do another review and they would call me in a week. They never did and when I called they told me same finding. To sum up I have been treated horribly	1
as a result	1
as a result of DOE finding XXXX was engaging in bad practices. Furthermore	1
as a result of a supposedly unpaid cell phone bill for an account with XXXX. I contacted Debt Recovery Solutions and informed them that ( XXXX ) I have never had an account with XXXX	1
as a result of your help	1
as a similar issue had arisen before. They refused to apply my payment to the XXXX XXXX payment date	1
as a third party is now documenting this abuse. on all fronts Toyota is "" trolling '' me. Furthermore the XXXX complaints do n't always go through. I have also as of today not received my new car purchase survey. It should be mailed to the address on this complaint. All future correspondences should be mailed to this address	1

as both my bank and myself have already spent waisted hours resulting in different answers from BOA I have doubts that we will be able to resolve the problem on our own. For the record	1
as certified by XXXX. They	1
as charged off and past due with a balance below the amount i provided as a security deposit. I called every year asking about unsecuring my card and each year i was told i was not eligible at that time. Year after year i was charged interest against money I provided as a security deposit. I received account fee 's	1
as conservator	1
as did the supervisor. Further	1
as directed by Chase. Five months into the agreement Chase is trying to record a foreclosure from XXXX five months prior. They also told my insurance I no longer own the home and to cancel my insurance while Chase once again added its force home owners insurance.	1
as directed by XXXX XXXX	1
as each bank said they did not have our money	1
as each promotional period expired	1
as early as XXXX days after a missed/late payment. She tries calling from multiple numbers too. It got to the point that we had to block the numbers from the office	1
as evidenced by my XX/XX/XXXX statement. I subsequently paid {$1.00} in XXXX	1
as expected. However	1
as explained by them. So	1
as hard inquiries affect my credit.	1
as he could not see the reason. I requested to pursue this matter in an appeal process because I should know the reason why my account was closed. I have been a member of XXXX bank and have never had any issues with my accounts including making on time payments.	1
as he is XXXX as to what he signs. I never stepped foot into that dealership	1
as he is a broker from whom I requested information on a property for sale ... and XXXX XXXX should have had no knowledge of my correspondence with XXXX XXXX. In my mind	1
as he presented himself with all the required information and documentation in XXXX different Moneygram locations in his town of residence	1
as her company called me.	1
as her husband	1
as his administrative assistant. She had answered an add online and communicated via emails with the knowledge that he was to arrive in XXXX within a week 's time. One of her duties was to set up a new office in XXXX	1

as if someone had used my information	1
as indicated above contacted me XXXX multiple times over the phone	1
as indicated by the attached XXXX and XXXX 2015 statement with the corresponding dates and purchases highlighted. In the first half of XXXX	1
as is there debt collection on the subject matter.	1
as is this situation! They purposely kept both payments and the second payment is just sitting somewhere!	1
as is true	1
as it dodged the questions via a loophole in the CFPB system.	1
as it has a balloon. I went online today	1
as it is my right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act	1
as it is not my debt. My final complaint response that was filed with your office and was not disputed	1
as it is printed on the card. Printing the whole card number on a paper just makes it one more security issue	1
as it seems fair within the Federal Regulations. So	1
as it seriously has set my credit score back. After reading about hard inquiries	1
as it states in my lease that I am not allowed to have any unregistered vehicles on the property without incurring additional fees..	1
as it stresses me out to think that Green tree is XXXX me off. I have asked and i expect a refund for all this time that i have been paying the wrong amount. I called Green tree a handful of times about this issue i have also fax them a letter showing my supporting documents and dont believe that now after more than 60 days of calling	1
as it was a total scam	1
as it was after business hours	1
as it was almost 20 years ago. Do n't call me again.	1
as it was reason for me to pursue a college degree and required this loan. Spoke with the Loans Consolidation department and the Loan Modification department to lower my payments	1
as it would clear up any further confusion by the Wells Fargo Home Mortgage Department.	1
as items still needed to clear. However	1
as late as XXXX	2
as long as I send all documentation required and complied with the trial payments scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX	1
as long as the refund processes well before the due date of the bill	1
as long as they received the payoff before the XXXX of XXXX I would receive a refund of at least the {$320.00} for the XXXX payment. The dealership mailed a payoff check on the XXXX of XXXX overnight mail to Chrysler Capital via XXXX with a tracking number of XXXX for the total amount of {$27000.00}. It was delivered on the XXXX of XXXX at approximately XXXX. As of today	1
as monies were tied up. GreenTree ( as DiTech was known at the time ) offered a streamlined loan modification	1
as most financial institute do not allow over pay a credit card. And without somebody explicitly tell me to do so	1
as my account has a block on it since XXXX XXXX	1
as my credit limit is only {$300.00}. Capital One has not responded to XXXX of my requests. On the last request made	1
as my payment would not get corrected again and again. Each time they said my credit score would not be affected. To make a long story short	1
as no activity remotely like this had never happened in the entire time I had an account at Wells Fargo.	1
as noted in my attached credit report	1
as of XXXX The said problem is not solved. All XXXX credit bureaus are showing I am XXXX days late it also shows the increased payment of {$860.00} not {$510.00}. To add insult to injury the bank told me I must write and request they remove the mistake from my account. I wrote the letter to an address I was given since the end of XXXX.	1
as of XXXX XXXX	2
as of XXXX/XXXX/2015. No one ever mentioned a {$25.00} balance.	1
as of this week ( opened mail XX/XX/XXXX	1

as per my knowledge weight was under XXXXlb on each pallet and paid in advance some of {$2800.00} to freight center	1
as per my request and will be honoring the cease and desist going forward. However sin the last few months I have received over XXXX threatening calls/emailed combined on my work phone and shared email account. when i post my XX/XX/XXXX payment on line as requested by a letter i received in the mail that it must be paid by XX/XX/XXXX	1
as per our emails. I found that they lied to me and did not lock me in with the 3 % saying that the forms needed to be completed first. They are completely unethical and dishonest. They were the ones that called me regarding the reduced interest rate and I quickly acted upon it. I took my time	1
as previously disclosed in your Cardmember Agreement and/or promotional offer ( if applicable ) made to you. '' This is very deceptive	1
as reflected on their record. I can not make a trip immediately. Chase 's notification is misleading.	1
as required by FCRA. I demand these inaccurate and or incomplete items to be removed from my files immediately.	1
as required by new federal regulations.	1
as required. Then I got the final modification documents to be signed and notarized. I did just that. I did n't notice that they were requiring my wife to sign on the documents	1

as soon as I answere yes I was told it is a attempt to collect a debt at no time did they identify themselves	2
as soon as I paid the balance in full my FICO score became an issue. Needless to say my credit score has been adversely effected by this action. Is this legal? Is this fair?	1
as soon as he gave his name	1
as soon as they determined who was calling.	1
as soon as they noticed they could money off of the home they sent a denial letter the same day and hired an attorney the next day to put us on the street ... .and this is when we are trying to sell the home voluntarily. It 's outrageous that they have not offered a single alternative to elderly people trying to do the right thing and get this debt repaid. We filled out whatever forms we sent them	1
as stated in the letter from XXXX XXXX!	1
as the Computer systems are already a part of the business operations. So we are charged {$38.00} for an overdraft that never really occurs as the payment is rejected..	1
as the alleged debt is outside the statute of limitations and can no longer be collected upon.	1
as the check was written on a closed account. I have contacted Green Tree Customer No-service XXXX times ( XXXX XXXX & XXXX	1

as the public record can not be.	1
as the state of CA does not allow the omission of the forgiveness as "" income '' after XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore	1
as the stewardesses told us about this	1
as the terms had not been satisfactory. It was my understanding that the {$390.00} appraisal fee was non-refundable	1
as there are different areas that would cover. I told him that I sent a letter to the address provided by Credco/CoreLogic	1
as they also are aware of my affidavit sworn of my true circumstances	1
as they are stating on the letter that they will settle for XXXX on the letter	1
as they are still applying interest at a rate that is not correct. I 'm getting threating letter that I 'm behind	1
as they could not hold federal funds by law. Prior to this I spoke to XXXX XXXX	2
as they must provide me a copy of my report and FREEZE MY FILE.	1
as they only ensure that I will have more trouble catching up on payments and being able to resolve my student loan debt. It 's my understanding that many of my private loans were bought by the DOE when regulations on student loans were first put in place. As a result	1
as they spoke very fast and unclear. The voice message said to contact XXXX tp verify information. I asked them to take my name off of their calling list and they said no	1
as they were provided a list of all debts to be consolidated under their program.	1
as they will mistakenly believe more money is available than they actually have	1
as they would n't be able to answer that for us. I contacted GreenTree again	1
as this was the very first thing I have received about this debt. In this paperwork it stated that if no payment was made that this would be reported to the credit bereau in 45 days. I made one payment on XXXX XXXX	1
as we have for the past XXXX years. When we received it	1
as we no longer reside together.	1
as we will raise this with the Department of Education in the US. They have advised that all loan providers who act as servicers for Federal loans should be using NSLDS to keep track of their borrower 's enrolment status. "" As a follow up	1
as we wished to remain in the residence. Since the filing	1
as well as	1
as well as a credit Account had an address change that was unauthorized. I immediately called Fifth Third call center and spoke to XXXX to be told my account address was changed via the phone. I asked to freeze accounts but could not be done on the phone so I went to the branch. The address was changed on my account by a person by the name of XXXX XXXX but why would that be in the bank notes and why would the bank allow another person to change account address??? I asked why the address would have been changed all they could tell me it was done on the phone. What? And what about multi faceted questions to check account holder??? HELP!!! My bank statement may have gone to this new XXXX address they could not tell me if that happened	1
as well as a fee to pay with a representative	1
as well as a serious delinquency. This is completely untrue	1
as well as all calls from debt collection agencies and all of their annoying robocalls. They now say I owe {$830.00}. Please understand that "" what i owe '' is many numbers. When I call I can get as many as XXXX different "" you owe '' totals. Its all XXXX. I "" technically '' owe them less than {$140.00}. Im no longer interested in paying the {$140.00} as they have cost me far more than that in aggrevation. I was a customer for 8 years with NOT ONE SINGLE LATE PAYMENT EVER for crying out loud	1
as well as an email conversation showing that I do not owe this debt anymore. That being said	1
as well as as late remarks on credit reports to be reflected as "" never late ''. The customer service rep agreed to this. I then commenced to pay the back charges	1
as well as contacted Social security My behalf without my consent	1
as well as continuous employment since graduation from XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and after a 1 Yr XXXX from XXXX University in XX/XX/XXXX. I feel my application was denied because of racial discrimination as an XXXX XXXX female and the bank is scrutinizing applications from XXXX	1
as well as countless others in my community contacted Chase about help. They say they can not & will not talk to us about this	1
as well as dates closed. I have contacted multiple times requesting the history and paperwork for this account and given no details on this account or information that is validating. No contract has been received by me	1
as well as denying us quiet	1
as well as dispute inaccuracies. Because of this I have been denied XXXX apartments and it has severely affected my credit score.	1
as well as disputed online.	3
as well as filed claims with multiple banks and filed a police report.	1
as well as harassed her with threatening language	1
as well as in writing on the same date. ( please see attached ) As well and also contrary to the above subsections the failure to provide the name and account of the original creditor	1
as well as incorrect dates ; amounts ; demographic information ; etc.	1
as well as knowingly convincing students to take on huge debts that they will more than likely not be able to repay. These actions should be criminal. Now I am constantly being called and harassed by XXXX Private loan	1
as well as my claim that the XXXX defaulted in the legal process answering the initial legal claim. Even though my federal claim takes precedent	1
as well as mycurrent address. It has been 3 days since I have submitted all this information	1

as well as other mostly payments not listed.	1
as well as our realtor trying to get any info from them	1
as well as restore my past credit history to reflect my loan not having entered a default status	1
as well as several other BOA representatives. I continued to make all of my payments for a year until my loan suddenly entered foreclosure. I spoke to over XXXX different representatives who told me that my loan was approved	1
as well as statutory authority issues with the upcoming trustee sale	1
as well as the FDCPA.	1
as well as the amount showing as still owed and not paid. I will write a letter to XXXX and Equifax about this matter but would appreciate any help expediting this process.	1
as well as the better business bureau	1
as well as the fact they bank would not accept monthly checks but required XXXX check only for the sum of the total due. They issued multiple letters with inconsistent terms and conditions and proceeded to change their positions as to which letter was the letter of record. Net result was what was XXXX days past due approached 90 days past due ( totally due to bank policies and programs ) not my ability to pay. These policies and programs generated additional revenue for the bank	1
as well as the job market	1
as well as the new institution was poor	1
as well as the personal financial information of my co-signers. When I asked my co-signers to complete the forms for my financial assistance application to Navient	1
as well as the stages of foreclosure. I call the bank and email and they can not give me any answers to my questions. It 's like I 'm talking to robots. I have worked my whole life and to have my home taken away from me due to a divorce is so very sad. I 've never asked for assistance in my life	1
as well as using targeted advertising to me specifically. If i was not eligible for the offer they presented to me	1

I asked for a copy of the banks privacy policy regarding personal information because he was entering into his computer all of the information that was on my drivers license. XXXX XXXX refused to produce this document. I called Bank of America customer service ( XXXX ) to ask for a copy of their personal information privacy policy and they refused to supply that as well. The phone operator told me that she could put in a request for this information to be sent to the account holder but that since I did not have an account I could not have access to this information. I strongly believe that the Federal Privacy Act is being violated in this instance. I have the right to limit the sharing of some of this information and I am not being allowed to do this.	1

at least XXXX customer service representatives from Green Tree have told me that they would see to it that the money taken in XXXX -- without authorization -- would be refunded into my account.

I know that wrangling over XXXX {$12.00} fees may seem silly	1
at least XXXX of these reasons are false.	1

at that point she hung up.	1
at that time I was eligible for the HomeKeeper Program thru the hardest hit fund. Due to this counselor being out of the office so much & everyone else in that office kept telling me she had to take care of it	1
at that time the payment on the XXXX mortgage will XXXX. I reached out to PNC mortgage in hopes to do a XXXX mortgage loan modification	1

at the end of the process the system told me that her identification is not verified and we need to go to a branch so as to further the application.	1

at the request of XXXX this agency has forwarded my previous complaints # 's XXXX and XXXX to Bank of America in error	1
at the time	1
at the time of closing in XX/XX/XXXX I was between jobs and was not allowed to close on the loan although I had bought my home back in XX/XX/XXXX and had never had any problems with my monthly payments	1
at the time of purchase - I have a bank account linked to PayPal - I was actually putting stuff on PayPal Credit. There has always been something suspicious and shaky feeling about XXXX	1
at the time of request the date printed on the letter was already BEYOND the date they needed to receive the information so I called explaining that I just received the letter and the date was already beyond that date and they told me not to worry and to just send it in. I faxed in the information immediately that day and got a confirmation that the fax was received both by the fax machine and when I called the next day to confirm receipt. I was told by a male supervisor that the fact had been received and that the account was currently in appeal status. A few weeks later I called in for a status update and also because I had received a letter indicating that because the information was not received on time that the provisional credit would be removed on "" XXXX '' date. I was told to ignore that because the fax had been received and that since the account was in appeal status that the credit would n't be taken back. A few weeks later I check my account its overdrafted and showed the credit was in fact taken back on the date the letter indicated. I called and asked what was going on and was told that they never received any fax and I need to re-fax it in. I did this again ... got a confirmation from both he fax and a rep that it was received. A few weeks later I got another letter this time indicating that I need to pay back the overdraft or the account would be charged off ... again I called and again I was told to ignore that letter because the account was in appeal status. So a few weeks go by I call for a status update and AGAIN I 'm told that they fax was n't received and I needed to re-fax. So this time I go to a branch and have them fax it	1
at the time the money was sent he was in his XXXX 's. And for awhile we were so frustrated with how we were treated. Even when I asked to please have a written policy sent to my email so that I can see for myself why I could n't pick up my money.	1
at the time we were not informed that this was the provider of the loan.	1
at this Time. Louisiana XXXX states that after 3 years a company can not attempt to collect on this type of account. The Statue of Limitations has Expired.	1
at this point I had no idea were it may be.I was hoping I had somehow misplaced it some place. I walked over to branch bank of key bank close to motel and they called XXXX XXXX who verified who I was and I took {$300.00} out of my account as my entire wallet was gone and I had no ID	1
at this point I wanted to speak to SOMEONE higher on the ORG CHART IDEALLY WITHIN XXXX to help with such an important issue ( CREDIT score going from Excellent to Poor within one month causing issue in getting a Loan ). XXXX stated that they do not have the capacity to elevate this further or even possibility to transfer to someone within XXXX for further discussion. IT IS BEYOND UNACCEPTABLE that an AGENCY working directly with / for the XXXX GOVERNMENT and impacting XXXX CITIZENS so seriously with something as important as CREDIT SCORE has NO ONE who can provide appropriate explanation on their methods and / or elevate the issue to appropriate customer service MANAGEMENT within XXXX. I also do not appreciate having to provide my social security number and such key information in current cyber environment so many times to so many people outside of XXXX ( or even inside XXXX for that matter ). I am beyond frustrated with first trying to understand the reason behind the actual issue and subsequently the bigger issue of sensitive information exposure	1

but I could give them a debit card	1
but I could n't help losing my job and dealing with the hardships has been a challenge to get back on my feet. Everyone goes through ups and downs and I want to do what I can to resolve my debt with my mortgage company. This is why I am trying to short sale the home and avoid foreclosure so I can put this past me and grow. My credit has already taken a huge hit and I would like to save it as much as possible from the foreclosure and close with the buyer we have the home under contract with. Bank Of America has wasted so much of my time with a loan modification and never provided updates or other options to help us. It has been extremely frustrating! They set us up to think they were working on the loan modification and in reality they were ignoring us. Every time I would call for updates	1
but I could not reach a live operator unless I purchased XXXX of their credit products from their web-site. I am attaching a copy of the letter that I sent to Experian. You 'll be able to clearly see there is nothing "" suspicious '' about my request. My letter is straight-forward	1
but I could pay by phone with a {$15.00} service charge. I told the rep that I would rather pay XXXX cents for a stamp. I mailed them a check for my mortgage payment and to my surprise they sent my check back saying that they had no records of my mortgage being transferred. After weeks going by I was finally able to get the account set up only to find out that CMS had charged me late fees	1
but I did file a police report and have that on file. I do n't like paying for something I never got	1
but I did go to the hospital. That same person said he had pictures of me at the clinic	1
but I did heard from XXXX saying that they updated the info	1
but I did n't realize I 'd be penalized for the full amount of the loan	1
but I did not carry a balance	1

but I do not own a fax machine. I own a PC with a printer and they refused to email the information because of their security policy!	1
but I do not understand why Ocwen refuses to give me the NPV and disclose the numbers they used in the HAMP review. Ocwen is evading issuing me the NPV chart after denying me for HAMP and HAMP 2. My attorney believes the program ( HAMP ) requires servicers to issue the NPV chart if they deny a borrower for the HAMP program. I was offered a regular modification with worse terms than I would be offered with HAMP. It appears Ocwen is doing this on purpose and they are unwilling to review me for HAMP and isssue the actual ( NPV ) findings solely to offer me a worse deal with worse terms which I can not afford.	1
but I doubt I will hear anything.	1
but I fear that they will.	1
but I feel that WF can rectify the situation after two weeks if it wants to expend a little effort. Or did I just lose {$6000.00} because I inserted the wrong number?	1
but I have NEVER ignored any letter or invoice that I have received in my life. They somehow got my name and address and attached it to the person who owed a debt. I do not who the creditor is. All of this has happened so fast that I am in a bind. The hearing is on XXXX at XXXX. How do I find out who is behind this and how to proceed?? I am XXXX and on a fixed income. I have perfect credit and do not want it or my reputation destroyed.	1

but I have n't heard anything from them. All I keep getting is the run around and no one knowing what I 'm talking about and I think they are trying to affect my credit	1
but I have never been refunded for the other 4 years of fees and related interest charged on those fees. I have complained each year which is probably why it did n't get charged in XX/XX/XXXX	1
but I have never ever been 30 days late!	2
but I have never has a phone with XXXX.	1
but I have no idea where to go to claim this money.	1
but I have not found any assistance with a modification review. I sent in countless documents and forms to prove my income just to be told I would not even be reviewed.	1
but I have not received it that states the reason for the denial and that there is no other options available but short sale under HAFA or foreclosure. I 'm at my wits end about the whole ordeal. I am afraid of the affect this will have on my husband as he has XXXX and the stress of the possibility of losing our home. I 'm praying for resolution in this issue.	1
but I have not seen any updates and no responses from Progressive Management S Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
but I have statements dating back to XX/XX/XXXX ) I spoke to a customer service representative named XXXX	1
but I have the EOB and the draft number of the cleared insurance payment. They wo n't communicate with the collection agency to let them know it is being researched. I 've called the collection agency. I 've been told that the {$520.00} was my "" deductible ''. This is n't true. I have also provided them with a copy of the EOB. I continue to get calls from the collection agency	1
but I have to call them every single month to get them to do that. There is something seriously wrong with this practice and it almost seems illegal.	1
but I havent gotten an answer yet. I would like this to be looked into please.	1
but I hoped the check would make it in time and since they had sent the coupon book late I felt reassured that they would n't charge me a late fee	1
but I just could n't do it all. My wife finally called Wells Fargo asking for assistance before we got behind. We remembered the assistance we received during the tornado disaster and thought maybe we could get medical hardship. The previous did not affect our credit ( or so we thought ) so we called. We were again connected to a "" Mortgage Specialist '' who assured us they were there for us and had a plan that would take care of us! They could take one month again and spread it out over six months. Such a relief!!!! We were going to make it through this nightmare. Fast forward to today. My wife is healthy and has been for a year and a few months! She has been given a clean XXXX from her doctors and is back to work full time	1

but I keeping receiving letters from them offering me the opportunity.	1
but I kept getting the run around and then finally denied for information for not providing information when I did provide it. So now all the property is doing is accruing debts. I have the house up for sell	1

but I received an error message asking me to call American Express Prepaid XXXX Account Protection. I called the number and was informed that my Prepaid REDcard account was closed. I was first vaguely told it was because of violating Prepaid XXXX Member Agreement	1
but I said I would pay when I can. Instead of trusting that I will pay when I can	1
but I shared with her the statues & laws they were breaking by not providing me a copy of my mortgage note upon my immediate request. Notes were then made on my account that I would finally receive my mortgage note by tonight ( XXXX/XXXX/16 ). Needless to say	1
but I should be happy I received the information. I sent monthly emails XXXX with no response or limited response. He only responded to me once XXXX office told him that I had reached out to complain during her lunch break. I received an email from him a half hour after his lunch break. I also requested my records XX/XX/XXXX	1
but I simply get transferred around and nothing ever gets accomplished. I have fully investigated my rights in this matter. Under the doctrine of estoppel by silence	1
but I spoke with XXXX XXXX from the collection agency and was told they would have the accounts removed from my credit report.I called today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and spoke with XXXX XXXX. He began to yell & scream at me because I asked how much longer is this suppose to take because I was initially told it takes 5-14 days. To date those accounts are still reflected on my credit report. I 've held my end of the contract but	1
but I still do n't have any original paperwork. I have done research about this collection company and there are similar complaints about this individual XXXX. I find these offenses to be great FCRA violations as I am XXXX and am held responsible for these laws and regulations. I feel that all should be equal and this company DATALINE should be held within the same standards.	1
but I still have not received an updated	1
but I still have not received anything. They refused to provide documentation and also stated they could n't send it until the bill was paid off.	1
but I still remained in Texas. However	1
but I take my shoes off at the door ). The new tenant moved in two days after we vacated. The credit bureau has a company called Fair Collections and Outsourcing - FCO that is reporting that I owe XXXX {$480.00} dollars ; I contacted XXXX and questioned their bill for {$230.00}. Their bill negates a deal that tenants got for 10 % of each monthly rent applied to a pot of money to be applied to closing costs for the purchase of a new home with certain builders ( {$120.00} x XXXX x XXXX = {$17000.00} ). FCO has refused to detail their bill with me and refused to remove it from my credit bureau for the last two years despite the difference of {$250.00} between their bill and that of XXXX. I continue to dispute this on all XXXX credit bureaus and they continue to tell me that it is a valid bill despite the fact that I have never seen the bill for {$480.00} and they are refusing to send to it me. Yesterday	1
but I then received a voicemail	1
but I think BB & T charges me for that service too. I would highly recommend you investigate BB & T as word is spreading quickly around XXXX Kentucky- other banks are getting new customers as people close their accounts at BB & T . We 've heard from a handful of different people complaining about the same thing and our credit union has even told us they 're hearing a lot of negative things going on with BB & T. Please do n't hesitate to contact me if you need me to provide more info. My email is XXXXXXXXXXXX and my phone number is ( XXXX ) XXXX	1
but I think it is unsat for them to arbitrarily and unilaterally change this important account parameter for existing accounts.	1
but I told them that it did n't make sense for me to go further in to debt since such a loan would be interest bearing and I would end up owing more then I do now.	1
but I want to know is there any accountability that Bank of America and XXXX Appraisal? We also request that we do not pay for the inaccurate appraisal report.	1
but I wanted to get the loans consolidated with a lower interest rate. Silly me.	1
but I was advised to accept it due to its free nature. In XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX	1
but I was denied. When I came home	1
but I was locked out from making changes to my banking information online. So I then contacted Citi again asking them how I should proceed. I then received another email letting me know that there was a secure message online. But when I logged into my account this time there was no letter ( PDF ) or electronic message. I also noticed that I was assessed a {$25.00} fee ( for a returned check ). And	1
but I was more concerned with my credit report so paid even when in effect I XXXX the HOA. ) To date	1
but I was n't a discover mortgage holder. I was mislead. Armed with all this new found information I contacted XXXX and my number was automatically directed to XXXX XXXX. So I called from a different phone number and spoke to a representative and asked for XXXX XXXX supervisor. I was told that I would return a follow up call from XXXX of the supervisors and I have n't heard anything from anyone since then. Now I did a refinance with a company that I DID NOT WANT TO DO BUSINESS WITH because I was mislead and I did not want another hit on my credit and almost 2 months later I still have n't closed. I 'm beyond XXXX for the fact that I was told incorrect just down right wrong information..I was taken advantage of and I 'm very upset.	1
but I was not able to take her call. She left a message saying she was out of town and would try me the following week. It 's been four weeks since her first call and I am still waiting for a callback. I just called Discover customer service and had them email XXXX XXXX asking her to follow up with me.	1
but I was on track with my XXXX 2015 until present. Technically and legally i am only XXXX and XXXX months behide. I agreed in XXXX 2015 to pay XXXX to bring my mortgage current starting in XXXX. My bank sent Wells Fargo a check in the amount of XXXX on XXXX XXXX 2015 for XXXX payment and also in XXXX XXXX for XXXX payment. Wells Fargo now is saying that I 'm XXXX behind and has put a foreclosure in place. When I called Wells Fargo to ask why did not my XXXX payment get applied to my loan	1
but I was only awarded for XXXX of my loans and not the other XXXX due to my cosigner income.	1
but I was re-granted membership in the credit union. Then	1
but I was told that the "" system '' was down and she ( XXXX ) could not help me. She explained to me that the application was denied because I am current on my payments. This is true ; however	1
but I was upset for all the people less fortunate than I who could have been unfairly charged	1
but I will accept your {$1500.00} and that will be that ''. While on the CFPB website	1
but I will say the people seem pretty competent ...	1
but I work for a bank myself and I know a little about deceptive practices that some individuals use to meet their sales goals. If I did not have inside knowledge	1

but I would prefer to do it via mail	1
but My husband is a XXXX Veteran and XXXX. explained that the valuation of my property decreased so the taxes are less. GreenTree reported derogatory information against my credit report. Very distraught how the family of a XXXX Veteran is treated by GreenTree. I provided them with {$160000.00}. to get the loan paid in full	1

but Paypal refuses to release my funds {$500.00}. What Paypal is doing is illegal	1
but Pioneer Credit continues to call in an attempt to find the debt holder. I told the caller to stop harassing my family. Hopefully it will stop as the FDCPA only allows them one communication per person ( which they have already exceeded to many of the above mentioned persons ) and they must stop if told to.	1
but Quicken Loans has refused to provide this stating that it is "" proprietary. '' I would like to know how and why this was scheduled without my having any input into the scheduling.	1
but TD wo n't accept that either. First of all this loan is on a property that THEY valued at {$270000.00}. I really only wanted {$30000.00} to pay off the mortgage and do some repairs. I have provided them with the information they requested. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is willing to write them a letter but they won '' t accept it. They obviously do n't want to give me the loan and want me to give up.	1
but US Bank has delayed the process to an extent that is unacceptable. Five years later and we are finally getting closer to being able to put this behind us	1
but Wells Fargo followed HUD guidelines in their case and did not report any information on them for the full nine months. I believe XXXX employee in management is being retaliatory because we reported her and she is responsible for the company not keeping its WRITTEN promise to remove all negative information.	1
but Wells Fargo said that was not possible because we still have more than $ XXXX to go.	1
but Wells Fargo still shoes up as a derogatory account. I will submit documentation to proof that I paid this account and left it in a XXXX balance in XXXX.	1

but XXXX XXXX XXXX reported it as open with a balance after that. I do not pay this debt and I did not reaffirm it. I recently disputed it again with XXXX who deleted the account. I recently applied for credit and it still shows up on XXXX and Equifax. This is impairing my credit and ability to make a fresh start. Some days I wonder what I went through the Bankruptcy for.	1

but XXXX told me the HELOC was written off.	1
but a debt collector	1
but a fee amounting to 17 % of the transaction to take out {$60.00} of my money appears to be abusive. I was not borrowing the money. Is this a "" Restocking '' fee or "" rental '' fee for my use of the machine? There is no electronic transaction fee between XXXX and Citizens that would cost anywhere close to the {$3.00} cost charged for the transaction. It feels like an abusive charge.	1
but a mediation firm and if I did not make the restitution payment	1
but a monthly payment continues to come out of my banking account	1
but a nominal fee of approximately {$25.00} to {$50.00}	1
but a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act	1
but a page with lots of lip service to privacy and security. There is XXXX stylized shield image labeled "" Privacy : Learn how we collect and use information '' ( which does not say anything about managing preferences ) and XXXX must simply guess that this is the right place to click to manage preferences. The page this links to shows even more lip service saying that consumers should "" Count on us to make your privacy a priority '' but still it 's not obvious how or where one can manage privacy preferences. Scrolling down	1
but a phone number and account number.	1
but a request for VALIDATION made pursuant to the above named Title and Section.	1
but access to the report I allegedly "" received '' on XX/XX/2015. As the consumer reporting agencies already maintain a record of my most recent date of "" file disclosure	1
but according to my loan docs it was supposed to be automatically removed on XXXX/XXXX/2015.	1
but added the old vehicle to it. The extra mileage was charged to this account and as a result	1
but adjust their policy to do so when the opportunity warrants. I feel BOA owes it to their customers/ clients to place them in a Mortgage that reflects the true value of their home and should make ample time to ensure all homeowners are given time necessary to salvage their lives do the financial crisis caused by BOA and other banks affiliated with this issue. With extra care to those who have served and lost part of themselves after serving in XXXX protecting our way of life. Some agents say thanks but actions speak louder than words.	1
but after 30 minutes	1
but after I insisted on receiving answers about the XXXX modification being changed Wells Fargo sent me a letter saying my HAMP application had been withdrawn at my request ( it had not ) and they placed my condo into Foreclosure status and set a sale date for this tuesday without telling me.	1
but after going through with their dispute department	1
but after holding for literally hours	1
but after reading and hearing how poorly this company was rated in customer complaints/reviews	1
but after researching the matter realized it was n't. now they say because the account is closed and the balance has been paid off they ca n't refundthose fees. I have always up to that point paid my bills on time. This has had an impact on my credit rating.	1
but after taking a closer look	1
but after the fourth or fifth	1
but again	1
but again no change in payment so no EOB. The claim was adjusted again on XX/XX/XXXX which reduced the payment XXXX paid from {$2700.00} to {$1900.00}. Even though there was a change in payment	1
but agreed. I then went into the branch XX/XX/XXXX to close the savings account	1
but all covered by the submitted XXXX application at the time ) Due to the manner in which billing is done at the medical center	3
but all the rest from XXXX	1
but all the time when they ask my firs and last name the hang up the phone. I called the XXXX the company that sent my bill to the collection agency	1
but all with different phone numbers so it is impossible to block. This has moved well beyond annoying and is now harassment.	1
but also I should have to pay him. I have been trying to get this resolved for weeks. I get nowhere and it 's affecting my ability to purchase a home	1
but also due to a "" penalty '' rate for making a payment late. I recall one-time being told that it would go back to the lower rate ( the lower rate being 25 % + or so ) once I made XXXX on-time payments. It 's hard to negotiate with XXXX but I tried	1
but also illegal as I am told per RESPA Reg X ( XXXX ) am supposed to be given a denial letter and also given 30 days to appeal. I tried calling Bank of America again today and once I put in my loan number their phone system will not allow me to speak with anyone. Only leave a voice mail. They are purposely withholding my denial letter in an attempt to foreclose my home. They have been dual tracking my foreclosure process since XXXX 2015. What is the point of having Respa Reg X regulation when banks like Bank of America are not held to adhere to the law?	1
but also more than the minimum due	1
but also the full balance of the Care Credit card. Now	1
but am in poverty. My house sold last week so I contacted creditors. The student loan lender is settling amicably and so is XXXX XXXX XXXX. But Citibank has a {$12000.00} card balance ( now {$16000.00} with interest ) and lien on my home. They told me that since I am "" rich '' they would only reduce the {$16000.00} ( now with interest ) to {$12000.00} ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ). I asked to talk to a supervisor. The supervisor	1
but am not sure because nobody ever told me who was my mortgage company	1
but am unsure where to turn. So here I am reporting what I believe to be fraud and so does XXXX XXXX. One of my biggest clues this was fraud was when the person on the end of the phone call called me a "" good for nothing XXXX '' after I refused to pay the debt I did not owe or give them anymore information. This has to be stopped.	1
but another collection agency started up again calling me and threatening me with serving me with papers when the debt was clearly too old to collect. This agency has contact my son	1
but any person with a brain would think you would want to issue a credit card to a person who can make the payments and has more than enough to cover the line of credit with liquid assets. We offered to give the statements showing that I had the assets to prove that I was a worthy candidate for the credit card	1
but any time I ask a question she just raises her voice and says I have to pay the full amount	1
but anyone knows that divorced people will have too many CC opened in their name right after the divorce	1
but apparently neglected to inform Quality Loan of this.	1
but approved much smaller loans that originally promised.	1
but are accusing us of being in behind -- and reporting that to the credit agencies.	1
but are now delinquent.	1
but are they allowed to call so often or to insult me and lie to me?	1
but as of XXXX	1
but as of today	1
but as of today I still have n't received the points.	1
but as shown when the CFPB sued them ( see attachment ) this did not exempt them from state laws.	1
but as we were current on our mortgage we could not qualify. Due to this situation	1
but assumed it had been done. I noticed looking at my yearly mortgage statement in XXXX XXXX	1
but at the bottom where it says "" account history ''	1
but at the end of XXXX were told that the underwriters had rejected out application. The foreclosure had to be three years old for us to be eligible for a home mortgage. I question why we were not informed of this from the beginning. We were devastated	1
but at the last moment changed it to 7.85 % .We have tried to get them to take me off loan-my son told chase verbally and in writing I did not sign for loan and they still will not take this off my credit report-which chase put me on all XXXX credit reporting agencies with a XXXX loan.my credit score has dropped.	1
but at the next page of their website they offer me my Credit report for a Fee {$7.00} ; 2 ) They refused to investigate Frivolous items in my Credit Report. Obviously CFPB did n't took any action against them so "" XXXX ''	2
but at this point I must want access to my funds. I am unable to make any purchases of any kind. I have a medical condition that requires medications daily and am unable to purchase. I contacted the XXXX office Friday XXXX XXXX and was told there was no package sent. Through them	1
but at this point I think the smartest option would be just to let it go into collection cuz Massachusetts will only let them garnish 15 % of my wages.	1
but at this time the person did a mistake and did n't suspend the auto payment of the full amount. What happened its that the minimum payment was done ( as requested ) in the amount of {$11000.00}	1
but because Bank of America will not update MERS to show the prior loan as inactive	1
but because I was never informed of their specific rules I am being penalized on my credit reports. What is very surprising	1
but because J P Morgan Chase has not and will not report payment history to credit bureau I can not meet underwriting guide lines to do the refinance. I feel this is being done to prevent me from being able to refinance and keep them from loosing my loan. I need help	1
but because Lender has randomly checked my credit and is n't comfortable with my performance in other matters has decided to lower my limit from {$300.00} to {$160.00} and has informed the credit bureau of such action.	1
but because i deposited a night before i was able to take an additional {$200.00}. I did n't want to take more because i had rent to pay that week	1
but because of WF 's accounting process they refused to amend the payment date to coincide with XXXX 's payment date which is on the first of each month. WF insisted on maintaining the XXXX of each month as the mortgage due date which disadvantaged us	1
but because of my past bankruptcy my payments were never reported to credit bureaus	1
but because the coupon had expired	1
but because their system was behind	1
but before that they did n't have a way of contacting me. I was never contacted regarding this. I feel that chase needs to stop reporting wrong information on my credit report.	1
but belongs with that booking agent card. Despite the no fee claim on the XXXX website	1
but below the monthly minium. They sent me to collections despite the fact I was actually making payments. When I ceased making payments due to lack of employment	1
but bordering upon abuse of the public to force them to buy services or products in order to get a service that is supposed to be free once a year. When I told Experian I wanted a free credit report	1
but ca n't speak with anyone because their office is closed.	1
but ca n't until I know what the real balance is .... not just an inflated amount they pulled out of their hat. At this point they just want to sell the home	1
but called me with information on getting a rental. On XXXX XXXX	1
but calls stating that I owe a debt.	1
but can not close the account. Seems dumb. Just close the stupid account	1
but can not find anything regarding that name	1
but can not get them to file the satisfaction/release after six months of the XX/XX/XXXX payoff.. I 'm aware of the XXXX dollar settlement with Ocwen & wonder how many complaints there have been like mine. Thanks-XXXX XXXX	1
but can not understand all the terms	1
but certainly no one at Navient is capable of doing it. I am so frustrated with not being able to talk to anyone at Navient who understands Accounting and can see the errors made in the XXXX entries they have made. I am hopeful CFPB can research and reconcile my account and ensure Navient processes the correct entries to resolve this.	1
but charges a fee ; which I find unnecessary. The only contact info I have and use to contact SLS was provided by previous servicing company.	1
but chase is telling us at this time there going ahead the foreclosure anyway	1
but contacted FF within 30 days to notify them of her death. They sent forms that asking our intent for the property. We checked the appropriate boxes that indicated our intent to purchase the property for the family. We also called them and had extensive conversation with a rep. She stated we could have XXXX extensions	1
but containing the name and address of a different XXXX XXXX client stating that my loan was being transferred as of XXXX XXXX	1
but could give me no assurance of recovering the funds. I must contact Wells Fargo Student Loan Department during their business hours Mon-Fri. Please help me to recover my money lest my family be evicted from our home. We are deeply distressed by the actions that Wells Fargo has taken against us.	1
but could n't due to XXXX factors. # 1 Being that Wells Fargo sold me a bad loan. I had no idea that there was such a thing. This means that it is n't insured by XXXX or XXXX XXXX. Therefore it is very challenging to be considered for any refinance options. The worst part about this is that I was targeted by Wells Fargo for refinancing numerous times	1
but could n't get any help or any answers. Each representative required the same information my name social security number	1
but could n't send something in writing. They said they would mail us their policy stating why they could n't provide a payment schedule	1
but could n't track any outbound email either. I think that it banks should be notifying consumers at any time that their rates change. Whether that is a phone call	1
but could not apply them to the principal and interest since there was a debit outstanding on my account for the escrow funds that were in dispute. I still had not received the information detailing why there was a deficit. I put in another request for the escrow assessment. Fifth Third Bank repeated they could not apply the funds I was submitting because their "" system '' was not equipped to process "" partial '' payments. I then took it on my own to contact my county tax department and insurance company to verify what was paid. Once verified	1
but could not get any straight answers regarding help and options to restructure or modify our loan.	1
but could not produce an invoice. I agreed to settle out of court	1
but debt collectors from XXXX XXXX continue to repeatedly call me and harass	1
but decided to take the application for the personal line of credit. I did some investigation and found that under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( Regulation B ) that the answer I received from XXXX XXXX regarding a HELOC would constitute a Declination without an application. Additionally	1
but declared me in default of my mortgage.	1
but denied to her in XXXX. I have not been contacted by MoneyGram after multiple times of trying to contact them. I have called	1
but desperately needed assistance and all programs were a false sense of hope. I was thanked by Wells Fargo for documentation 8 days prior to auction of my home XX/XX/XXXX. I was attempting acceptance into home preservation program from XX/XX/XXXX until the following XX/XX/XXXX. The timeline of foreclosure	1
but did deduct {$200.00} from my checking account. That day	1
but did n't get the bonus as promised. I needed to email them multiple time and call them before I finally got the {$400.00} credit.	1
but did n't. We repeated this process each month for a few months	1
but did not offer to correct my credit bureau report. My request is to correct my credit bureau report to reflect no delinquency as a result of this bank error.	1
but did not provide any evidence the debt is still owed.	1
but did not put the house payment in the bankruptcy.We tried another modification .The modification was for me to pay {$660.00} down and {$300.00} in lawyer fees.They lied to me again. They went up on the payments. I ended up finally in foreclosure.I tried XXXX more time for a modification.This time they came back saying I did n't have enough income to pay a modification. I though that was why they do modifications. so I let them take back the home.	1
but did not receive the {$100.00} bonus reward. Over the last two months	1
but did not remove PMI. On XX/XX/XXXX	1
but did not transfer me any money	1
but did pay the late fee	1
but did say I could deed in lieu to them. They sent paperwork for that calling my loan in default when I have never made any sort of default in payment	1
but different nonetheless. I was advised that I was in fact calling "" a part of XXXX '' and that it was not an outside collection agency and I would be referred to an outside collection agency as of XXXX/XXXX/15. I informed her that I requested a final bill via mail when the service was disconnected. She "" verified the information with XXXX '' and proceded to explain that she will send a bill but the account will still be referred to an "" outside collection agency '' on XXXX/XXXX/15. I was not even giving the opportunity to pay the bill before it went to collections.	1
but disclosure Letter from BOA said "" not to worry if we were in refinance process ; that it would n't effect the refinance ''. Then	1
but do n't have anything or anyone to contact.	1
but do not know how to proceed. Please advise	1
but do so in an attempt to make erroneous statements and cause undue stress and frustration. If they are unwilling to accept resolution options than I am at a loss for how else to rectify this situation and stop these repeated threats and harassment. No company should be able to attempt to bully a consumer	1
but does not include the stolen items and the value of the damage is incorrect. The damage was so unusual I was frightened for my safety and my XXXX year old. The police officer stated that in 10 years on the force had he seen something like that. Under the advice of an attorney friend I was told to contact the bank to see if they might have done the damage. Phh confirmed they had been to the property the previous morning. I was told a supervisor would call back. It never happened. I called back the next day and Phh mortgage now said they could n't disclose such information. I again waited for a supervisor to call. In XXXX I called to try to make an {$8000.00} payment towards the {$11000.00} I owed. I was told that I should file again for a forbearance. The representative at Phh told me I pre-qualified for a forbearance and the {$11.00} could be paid at a later date also if I qualified. She sent out a packet and transferred me to a supervisor. The Supervisor noted I had called back in XXXX to complain about the damage and trespassing at my home. He said the XXXX phone calls were recorded but that even though every 3-5 weeks someone had been to the home that XXXX there was no record of someone being there. The documentation that proved they had been to my house suddenly vanished from the record. In XXXX the bank said I did not qualify for the forbearance because I was too many months behind and now an attorney debt collector was involved for forclosure. Now I had over {$1000.00} in attorney fees and {$480.00} in property preservation fees for the damage they did to my property. In XXXX I was told to not make a payment and to file a forbearance even though I could not qualify and as a result I had more fees added. In XXXX Phh mortgage cancelled my homeowners insurance again stating I had abandoned the home and it was vacant. This was the same time I was trying to obtain a forbearance and then was working with their attorney to try to settle the back payments. On XXXX 27 days before i had to become current I had my attorney become involved. He tried to work with phh mortgage 's attorney. We requested {$1500.00} for the damages	1
but does not issue these funds to the borrower. My loan modification lasted almost 3 years and I always paid as agreed on the first of the month	1
but due to the language barrier	1
but each time I am redirected to her. I have given all the pertinent documents that they have requested online. I received a letter from NationStar stating that I make enough money and was denied any kind of modification assistance. At this time	1
but each time the bank fails to follow through. He has stated repeatedly that the underwriter is "" ready to give final approval '' and that my file "" meets the guidelines '' for this loan product.	1
but easy to get information. When I answered their questionnaire they asked me for my bank & bank account number	1
but ensured us that everything was received and we could disregard the letters that we received and to continue to make our monthly trial payments until the modification was finalized.	1
but even after an investigation by XXXX this account remains reported as an open collections account. I would like it removed.	1
but even those were not effective. Today I called again to complain. The Service Rep to me that charges XXXX go to the balance	1
but eventually a color copy was provided to them.	1
but everytime I tried	1
but failed to show or give me a copy.	1
but fairness is.	1
but far from devaluing. The mortgage lender approved the loan using stated incomes and the associated documentation	1
but feel that there is rampant fraud throughout this issue. I do n't believe myself or other consumers should have an obligation to continue to pay on financing for vehicles that were sold deceptively. I have made no progress working directly with Volkswagen. Seeing as the company sold and financed a fraudulent product	1
but felt that it would be faster & easier to just pay it. I did not want any derogatory information to appear on my credit report. Now	1
but few days latter Equifax went back to the old numbers	1
but finally in XXXX of XXXX	1
but for now I want to submit a complaint about my current issue. In XXXX XXXX the renters I got to cover my mortgage payments up and left with over {$3000.00} dollars in damage and unpaid back rent. I was forced to leave my home in XXXX XXXX because my Husband killed himself there and my children were diagnosed XXXX and had been given medical advice to leave the home	1
but for them not to provide the help that stated they would and not. I am following the information my XXXX XXXX adviser stated I should do	1
but found it difficult and started the process XXXX of XXXX of modification and assumption which customer service representative stated I could apply for	1
but found that I 've been charged again for XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I 'm sure I 'm about to be charged again for XXXX XXXX. I would like a refund of the charges	1
but frankly	1
but from my basic elementary understaning there are multiple violations that have been commited by the CRA and there has to be something that needs to be done. This is creating so much damages	1
but from my employer- who was becoming very irritated. After escalating our loan to supervisors/managers - we were told we did n't qualify	1
but gave no response or further contact from them. There has been no attempt to correct the problem.	1
but gave us no opportunity to stop the illegal transactions. We are a retired military family and {$14000.00} might not sound like a lot for USAA	1
but given that there were no charges on teh account	1
but goodness how do I fix if they are n't posting and receiving payments. I want to get this up to date asap. What can I do? I am afraid to double the payments as they may then deposit and post the old and new monies.	1
but got back a messy canned response that repeated several sentences ( obviously a bad copy and paste job ) that claimed that all postings to my account were done correctly. Should n't Chase have applied my payments to the higher APR such as is mandated by the CARD Act of XXXX?	1
but had a wonderful husband to whom she was devoted to for XXXX years.	1
but had indicated we had all the necessary documents that were provided. Then after a month went by ocwen had changed the relationship manager	1
but had no luck in getting it removed.	1
but had no luck with recovery of information or help.	1
but had no real idea that she was behind on the payments	1
but had not applied it to my loan. She assured me that she would correct it and I would make XX/XX/XXXX payment to Carrington. I set up autopay and XX/XX/XXXX payment was posted by Carrington on XXXX. On XXXX I received registered mail from Carrington advising me that I was in default by 2 months and they had filed an intent to foreclose. When I called Carrington they were unconcerned about the notice and told me to disregard. My understanding of the loan transfer procedure is that they can not make collection attempts	1
but had social security send me a new card so they could n't take out payment.	1
but has failed to do anything more. I just received a foreclosure prevention packet in the mail this week as well. Ocwen has since increased my mortgage payment by more than {$200.00} additional each month. I am unable to pay the bogus amounts that Ocwen is reflecting as they have added even more unexplained fees and charges to my account after the discharge with no explanation! I have sent a complaint to XXXX and the IL states attorney XXXX XXXX 's office	1
but has my name saying i owe money. After dealing with him for two weeks he stated we are at a stalemate	1
but has no explanation why the disbursement was never completed and continued to hold and draw interest on more than {$4000.00} in our escrow without any action until we complained and demanded disbursement on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and XXXX/XXXX/2015.	1
but has not been helpful. They have offered others warranties	1
but has refused to reimburse me	1
but have also had a representative of Arnold Scott Harris ' collections department confirm the statement was 100 % false.	1
but have called me XXXX times a day since Monday XXXX/XXXX/2015. Apparently	1
but have maintained all insurances with them. I have called USAA multiple times trying to access my information and they have refused to help me in this. Their only excuse is because of I have a credit card in bad standing with them	1
but have never heard back fro the United States Postal Service or the local investigator handling my case. I was shocked to learn that my data is now linked to credit cards	1
but have not been successful until this week	1
but have not heard anything as of this complaint. Could you please find out why western Union or the store needed my Full SSN	1
but he continue to pressure me to ask	1
but he did n't. When I followed up to talk to the manager	1
but he does n't even know my pin #	1
but he is being very forceful and very abusive in his calls. The agent 's name was XXXX with Asset Systems.	1
but he just transferred me to a VM box. As the consumer	1
but he never did. I do not understand why I can not get a statement of my payments and balance as a contract holder when I am making payments every month and have never been late.	1
but he or she told me they would contact the tax department and someone would call back.	1
but he refused. He then said he would transfer me	1
but he said it was because my husband was joint owner of my checking account. I explained that I did not file Chap XXXX and I was primary on the account. I told him I HAD to make my payment and he said there was no way for me to pay it because it was charged off. I said there 's no way with my job that I could have something like that on my credit and he needed to find a way for me to pay them. He insisted that was not possible for me to pay the account and that he GUARANTEED it would not show up on my credit. I pulled a credit report on XXXX/XXXX/15 to find there was "" no data '' for XXXX and the remaining months show charged off. I called Bank of America again on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX and spoke to XXXX who said she would take the payment for the total amount and I said I needed to talk to a manager before I did that. She assigned me another case # XXXX and that someone would follow up with me about this. No one has called me or mailed any further information to date ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ). If they were going to charge it off due to my husband 's bankruptcy	1
but he stated he would send another letter and hung up. I tried to call again and ask for the address and another gentleman hung up on me. The XXXX time I called	1
but he still does it. Please do something to stop this harrassment	1
but he was denied	1
but he wo n't talk to me. I am planning to buy home soon	1
but he yelled at me and said that they would continue to list it as paid on my credit report	1
but how in the world could anyone pay off a balance with no job when they continue to increase with no cap? I tried to negotiate with them to have me pay off the balance at a set fee	1
but i did not realize it till XX/XX/XXXX	1
but i have never heard of ERC and i wish this to be investigated. i have copies of my credit report and XXXX XXXX was the last company that handled this and the company that removed the collection.	1
but i have still not received my credit card	1
but i have told them i simply can not do the payment in full. The delayed the process to turn it over to a collection agency	1
but i manage in my slum. how can they do this when they listed it for over 60 days on this auction. i was told the foreclosure would be on hold during and after this XXXX time period the auction completed and there were no offers	1
but i never had chance to get bonus miles for airline ticket	1
but i still have XXXX in my collections. I stopped these payments and do not feel like i owe them anything. This was also several years ago	1
but if I can make monthly payments with that very same credit card	1
but if I did	1
but if I do n't make the minimum payment I will hurt my credit and be charged all of the interest I have saved so far. This is deceptive and misleading.	1
but if it was	1
but if they failed to find me there	1
but if your just checking your balance and keeping track that way no idea	1
but in XXXX XXXX	1
but in a position to make up past due plus current payment. Was sent a letter of intent of aforeclosure. We went through a negotiating meeting with banks attorney and was given revised payment. We subsequently paid on time 11straight months. We sent all documents per their request to stay in good standing.they could not account for 11 months of payments. Documents were resent after bank lost them again. They refused to approve XXXX short sale contracts.sold house in sheriff sale in XXXX	1
but in exchange for the removal of the negative entry on my credit report. At one point	1
but in fact Ocwen has acted in a way that was deceptive	1
but in no way associated with this loan. XXXX XXXX has contacted me on my cell phone	1
but in the document of transfer	1
but in the end	1
but in the end could not explain why	1
but in the interim the loan was sold to XXXX. They are showing that I owe more than I actually do and I need for Chase to resolve this issue. Along with the waiver of late fees & any other fees and update the credit bureau as well as properly report to XXXX & have them also update the fees & credit bureau reports for me.	1
but in the letter it stated that "" If you have any questions regarding this correspondence	1
but in the meantime	1
but in their response to my complaint	1
but incurred more interest charges of {$63.00}	1
but instead it is hurting me. What 's the point of making payments if will still be reported late?	1
but instead keep referring me to different departments or people. I 've called three times already and now have to call again. I would like them to listen to side and follow the charges versus the payments as I have done. Also	1
but instead of listening they try to trick me into making a payment- which I am not going to do. This was not my account and I will not be making any payments to it. I knew nothing about this account XX/XX/XXXX	1
but instead of re-financing	1
but instead sent a letter dated XXXX XXXX	1
but instead they are robbing us. CFPB	1
but is The Department of Veterans Affairs	1
but is a contributor to our living expenses. We were both forced into retirement because of XXXX condition	1
but is applying the excess amount to future payments and holding those funds until that payment is due thusly	1
but is being used as another delay tactic. I 'm not sure why this process is taking so much time and effort on so many people when there is a seller	1
but is disclosing confidential information that no one else should have knowledge of. I have retained the voicemail message for my records.	1
but is not always possible for me	1
but is recorded as having no payment history. Our loan originated through XXXX Mortgage and placed with XXXX Mortgage. The loan was then acquired by the XXXX XXXX XXXX and ultimately transferred to Ocwen. Ocwen 's refusal to report payments to the credit bureau has immeasurably compromise our ability to reestablish our credit worthiness and denies our ability to acquire a new loan on a replacement home as we are bound but the irresponsible conduct of Ocwen. We have never missed a payment nor assessed a penalty of any kind or description. Yet	1
but it 's almost impossible to get any of these creditors to even acknowledge they had a form submitted in my name	1
but it 's been over 30 days since the judgement	1
but it 's comical how there is no way to identify me	1
but it 's never enough. I 've now fallen behind on my federal loans and I feel like I 'm out of options. I would gladly pay my loans if the amount every month was a littler more reasonable.	1
but it appears that they do n't want to help us. Our loan is now XXXX years past due with lots of fees and costs. They are refusing to entertain any offers. They offered us a modification after they denied our request four times. Then started foreclosure proceedings on XXXX XXXX	1
but it basically defrauds the government because they are participating in the HAMP program and the HAMP program requires the lender ( SLS ) to offer a new payment which is 31 % of my income. The offered final mod dated XX/XX/XXXX IS NOT 31 % of my income. It is 37 % of my gross monthly income. I am asking CFPB to please demand SLS comply with an actual review and correction to the error in my income calculation. So far when my attorney talks with SLS they only push for me to just accept this final modification. This final modification is fraud and uses the HAMP 1 program without lowering my payment to 31 % of my actual income.	1
but it being denied a loan because of Navient and/or XXXX misleading credit report.	1
but it did not concern the customer service representative. We moved to XXXX for a job transfer in XXXX	1
but it did not show my name as listed on the XXXX account. I called this morning and spoke with XXXX XXXX. I advised her I received the documentation only showing that the account was drafted under XXXX. She was extremely rude and berating. I advised her that I requested further documentation proving the account was mine. She then in a heated and belittling voice told me that was the documentation	1
but it did not state that this amount was the amount needed to avoid eminent foreclosure. When I contacted them to inform them of this	1
but it does n't make it right. Thanks for listening.	1
but it doesnt. Usually when there is a case of Fraud on my card where a large purchase ( always more than {$500.00} ) is made to a strange vendor	1
but it feels much more like deceit.	1
but it has been submitted ''. I checked again today XX/XX/XXXX and it still is not fixed. Right now the company is holding {$4800.00} that should be applied to principle during XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX	1
but it is beginning to become bothersome and concerning. The other numbers involved are : XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX ; XXXX. Again	1
but it is not a security freeze and even when I attempted to "" lift the freeze '' Experian shows no freeze ; however the credit union provided me with the documents.	1
but it is not from this year. The way it 's listed pulled down my score	1
but it is not possible. Whenever I try to call the wait is longer than XXXX minutes. for 9 %	1
but it is still at 3 %. I am getting ready to sell my home and need this corrected and the incorrect amount that has been applied to interest needs to be applied to my principal balance. I also have never received any buyer/owner incentive that my HAMP modification indicated I would be receiving ( {$83.00} per month or {$1000.00} per year ). I am approaching my XXXX year into the modification and have never received any documentation indicating this incentive had been credited towards my principal balance.	1
but it is still wrong.	1
but it is unable to provide with method of verification or documents showing different information than what I provided directly from Department of Education. TransUnion is violating my consumer rights under FCRA	1
but it looks as though I have been seeking additional credit lines	1
but it never came. My wife called them and explained she was concerned that someone could have been able to change our mailing address and could be using the card info fraudulently. Of course the could n't tell her anything since her name is n't on the account. So I called and the address was correct and they promised to send another statement	1
but it only being approved for one month and no communication of the arrangement being changed until they began calling me asking for the payment that I was n't supposed to have to make. They call every couple of hours from XXXX different numbers ( XXXX in XXXX	1
but it probably went to my email junk folder. So how I got their final email which they actually sent to me. They wave the fine but still end up charging 3 months interest. This seems to be the practice they use to collect extra money from their customers. Also the late payment gets reported on your credit and you get a low credit scoring. This is unfair and unethical for them to use such practices. Now Paypal is a big company	1
but it took them 5 months to finally DENY the loan	1
but it ultimately took the BBB to resolve the issue. Equifax still would not let me "" attach '' a document as you have allowed here.	1
but it was an escrow shortage that came from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Keep in mind I have all the dates	1
but it was being sent to an address where I have never lived and/or been associated. I contacted the bank to ask them why/how this happened. They initially insisted that I had been a victim of fraud	1
but it was denied because we did n't let XXXX know ahead of time that we would be making a purchase outside of the country. Being it was the weekend	1
but it was likely sold to another company.	1
but it was n't lifted. I called back	1
but it was obvious that they had not read the original letter of XX/XX/XXXX	1
but it was one of the few with payment protection and it could have made a large difference	1
but it was resolved with my money in my escrow. I have sent in two formal complaint letters to my mortgage company trying to understand the issue. I have also requested documentation proving what all my escrow disbursements since XX/XX/XXXX have paid. My first written dispute was sent on XXXX XXXX	1
but it was sold since XXXX	1
but it was until XXXX	1
but it will cause your loan to be increased and payments would be higher. ( Enclosed are copies of the emails re-conversation ). He then stated I will send you a copy of the Settlement Statement showing how the escrow balance will be applied to the principal. On the original settlement	1
but it would n't reset my password although it kept acting like it would -- i.e. sending me a reset link through email. It took a lot of digging to find the corporate headquarters phone number. I was forwarded through XXXX departments there and finally got customer service. But I was aware	1
but it would only allow me to pay my interest on the loan and nothing more. Bayview is a terrible servicing agency and is creating issues for their customers and needs to be held accountable.	1
but it would take up to two weeks. Someone should investigate the cancellation policies for Equifax 's credit monitoring services. Customers should be contacted to confirm that they would like to renew their product before being charged. There also needs to be some form of a cancellation or opt-out window without customers facing penalties. Had I not been employed within the financial services industry	1
but its still showing on my account as negative. Thank you for helping me with solving these matters	1
but just found out that my payment was being dispersed to both loans. Now I am delinquent on both loans. The loan I was trying to keep up with has a co-signer that I did not want to ruin their credit due my unemployment. I called AES and explained my situation but they refused to adjust the payments to the XXXX loan I was trying to keep current. By looking at the payments I have made	1
but keep getting rejected for different reasons. 1 Reason was that since my mortgage was 30 days behing when Hurricane XXXX hit ; I was in-eligible. I dispute this. 2nd Reason was that my income & mortgage expense did not meet guidelines. 3rd Reason was that I did not qualify for HOPE Tier XXXX since there was too much equity in home even though the Chase Real Estate estimate showed that the Home Value was lower than mortgage owed. They acknowledge Hardship	1
but lack confidence that this will actually happen. I am concerned that if I use the US Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in a XXXX country that I will end up with transaction fee charges and that the bank will point to the publicly posted fee schedule.	1
but later I found out they were representing B of A. I replied to the inaccuracies of that initial response letter	1
but later found out that XXXX 'investigated ' this issue and confirmed the 'debt '.	1
but lower my credit empirical.	1
but made a payment today. I am not in foreclosure and have been negotiating with them since XXXX XXXX on a modification. However	1
but made the payments and gave me a check for XXXX to put on the loan. Where the money went to we have no idea and we have been making inquiries and so far no response.	1
but makes nag them a lot more money.	1
but managed to keep up my end until XXXX XXXX	1
but mine do not. And HER Debit card earns rewards at XXXX level and Mine earns at a lower level ( rewards ) The BoA rep says accts can not be combined and ONLY Individual accts count! That is NOT what is published.	1
but more than what I should have been charged to cover escrow and called again ( XXXX XXXX ) I was assured they knew of the error and they were working to correct. Today	1
but most times they were n't even willing to talk to me. I eventually settled and paid the loan off through a collector for {$1500.00}. Only a few months later	1
but my Uncle ( XXXX XXXX ) is also on the Deed	1
but my account page on their web site STILL shows the XX/XX/XXXX payment plus late charges due. They have NEVER DONE WHAT THEY SAID THEY WOULD DO ON THE PHONE. They blame their "" system '' but I pointed out to them that there 's a human somewhere who owns and operates their "" system '' AND THAT PERSON IS NOT DOING THEIR JOB. I am deeply concerned that Ocwen is mismanaging my money and my mortgage	1
but my bank says there is no other proof they can offer.	1
but my case has been closed in advance of the deadline!	1
but my complaint is never addressed or fixed by the representative I talk to.	1
but my credit report has n't been updated to reflect a positive outcome.	1
but my credit report still shows that as a serious delinquency	1
but my credit union stated that Macy 's should have sent me a paper statement. I called Macy 's American Express again and this time I was told that there had been a letter sent out in XXXX stating that they were no longer going to be sending statements electronically through my credit union 's bill pay. I do not recall receiving this at all and what I do not understand is why the company never sent me any statements until I asked them to.	1
but my decree shows that this responsibility is hers and hers alone. The negative impact her continuing poor financial management is having on my credit score is unreasonable. I respectfully request that this entry is removed from my credit score.	3
but my handsome had me financially striken with unforeseen unpaid business taxes	1
but my interest rate was pretty high and almost 7 years later I am still dealing with this. My husband and I are trying to purchase a house give our children something we did n't have. This mistake has been haunting us for so long. The repossession is the first thing that pops up on my credit report and the banks do n't want to help us ... until now. We found a lender that is will to work with us if we are able to have this repossession move to the bottom of my credit report. I 'm praying for some grace! I 'm much older now and wiser. I 've been teaching my oldest daughter about credit and finances and how important it is to read and search on things before you sign anything. Do your research before you agree to anything. A very hard lesson I had to learn	1
but my loan is still listed as in foreclosure on my credit report	1
but my loan servicer will not work with me to make that possible.	1
but my name was not on the document. He said it was likely an oversight but of no consequence	1
but myloancare does not respond to my inquiries	1
but navy federal bank tellers are horribly trained to look for these fraud checks. So now I am behind on all my bills on my navy federal account which includes my car loan personal loans and credit card and line of credit. I was already financially struggling	1
but negative. They told me they can charge me interest anyway	1
but never answered XXXX. Why is it based on loan amount & not value and why XXXX instead of XXXX. XXXX. Why was the appraisal suggested if it was n't going to benefit my situation. I 'm very frustrated that they have different rules and extremely upset that they suggested a costly and non beneficial appraisal.	1
but never corrected it. Had to withdraw savings	1
but never did. Apparently	1
but never entered the XXXX system	1
but never got the money promised. The lady said it could have been their software/internet issue	1
but never got through. At one point I kept the phone on "" speaker phone '' for XXXX minutes	1
but never got written confirmation	1
but never had any lates on my mortgage the mortgage was always paid on time and current	1
but never happened. they do not want to release my money. on XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX payroll personal ( XXXX ) called the ADP and I was on the XXXX line with them	1
but never provided a reason or any written denial. I should have qualified according to the rules. They later offered a streamline mod	1
but never received notice of this overdraft and fees. Given it was closed quickly after it occurred and they wrote it off	1
but never received the paperwork. In XXXX I received a debt collection notice from ARSTRAT. I contacted ARSTRAT and they refused to provided validation of the debt. All they woulod tell me was that it was XXXX XXXX. They claimed that the debt was valid because they sent it. They would not provide any information or a contact at XXXX to verify the debt. ARSTRAT also misrepresented the amount I owe. They told me on the phone that it was XXXX. This is not the amount XXXX was seeking. They told me that XXXX sent this amount to ARSTRAT and that is the amount I owe. They then proceeded to give me a fake XXXX Phone Number. I spoke with XXXX and XXXX	1
but never received written detail from AMEX by XXXX Mail ( or otherwise ). Also	1
but nevertheless I agreed. He asked me my name	1
but no	1
but no corrections were made to this XXXX either. ( This document is attached to the complaint ) I was advised to sign a disclosure that I had 3 days to review my CD	1
but no matter how many times l tell them and call them the l fille for bankrupt	1
but no more. XXXX said	1
but no one could give me an answer	1
but no one has	1
but no one has managed to fix this for me to date. I 've faxed Nationstar my bank account statements from XXXX & XXXX and	1
but no one is willing to fix this or compensate me for this embarrassment. Now I live with this for 7 years? I need some assistance with this horrific error and violation of my credit security.	1
but no one responds to me. I do not know the status of my loan and have not received my appraisal report.	1
but no one seems able to correct this problem. The credit card is worthless to me if it is n't doing what it agreed to do. I should be able to change which purchases I make earn the most points	1
but no one told me I needed a certificate and the dealership did not ask for XXXX. The dealership	1
but no one will tell me why Wells Fargo thinks I owe them money. I should not owe on a deficiency because Wells Fargo failed to pursue that course of action within XXXX months of the foreclosure. I do not believe I owe them anything.	1
but no paperwork has happened ). They can not give me a loan number over the phone	1
but no record can be found. They sent the account to collections and say I was notified	1
but no response as to why. I suspected that there was some time of violation	1
but no response from them either.	1
but no response will be sent. '' They absolutely can not get it that I paid with my check for the refinishing of the damaged hutch in the amount of {$1200.00} and that amount should have been credited to my account	1
but no response. He finally called and spoke to a supervisor and was toold we did not stick to agreement and needed to pay that day. We insisted on getting a letter first and still have not recieved one. This was XXXX XXXX and XXXX. We have money to pay	1
but no such chargebacks or claims were made ( as verified by paypal when I called ). In addition	1
but no way to stop these calls!! Word of advice realize when your are checking a box to receive information about your account realize you somehow explicitly consent to debt collectors harrassing you in the process. Oh and also realized when I checked through my statements that they are charging me interest going directly against their promotional 24 month no interest. All one big stressor impeding on my school work	1
but none could offer assistance. Finally	1
but none pertain to my actual situation. They refuse to move forward and refuse to refund any of my cost	1
but none were performed. To correct the shortage	1
but not apply it to the available credit. They say	1
but not for any penalty or interest	1
but not given any time frame or further explanation from the Bank. On XXXX XXXX I was advised by a CSR that my account has been closed because they were unable to verify my identity.	1
but not on my credit report. ( SOL must of ran out	1
but not only did the person I spoke to have very broken english	1
but not received by me I complained to Capital One. They arbitrated an agreement with XXXX XXXX to reissue the order	1
but not someone else 's. The salesman indicated I would not be responsible for XXXX 's car payment. They just needed someone to vouch for him that had good credit. I live at home and have no "" real '' assets. I am upset about this incident. I did not intend to or realize I would be liable for this debt or it would reflect on my credit report. I was pressured by the Saleman and XXXX XXXX. At the end	1
but not the account that was processed on the XXXX as a balance transfer. I asked why the person I spoke with did not explain this to me and was told that they were unsure as to why. I then asked why the previous customer service rep. did not just advise me to write a check for the amount of XXXX transfers instead of the XXXX and received the same "" Unsure '' response. I feel that I was mislead into believe that the balances I transfered over to USAA would be covered under the promotion offered to me	1
but not the actual statements. When I asked why I have n't received a phone call he said that it was n't necessary to call the customer when they are delinquent. I used to work as a collections rep	1
but not the liabilities	1
but not the other ... no explanation why	1
but not with XXXX. I have disputed this with XXXX multiple times and every time it is coming back as valid and that AR Resources us validating the debt. This is in violation of the Federal Bankruptcy code. I have also mailed AR Resources letters stating this and have gotten no response.	1
but not with one another. I completed all the required documentation and forms and provided all the requested info to pursue the short sale. All this stuff was submitted to Greentree via my attorney who was authorized to represent me. Greentree continued to pursue the foreclosure process and they continued to contact me about not making mortgage payments. The folks that my attorney were working with seem to be the only ones that knew what was going on. I continued to receive letters assigning me new customer account reps as well as letters stating that they need more info. I sent every XXXX of these letters to my attorney and my attorney assured me that she was talking with the loss mitigation department XXXX times a week and they said they had everything they needed. I received XXXX or more letters stating that my short sale request was declined. XXXX of them was when all the info was already reviewed and submitted XXXX for review. Why would I receive a letter stating that my request for a short sale was denied due to no response from the seller 's agent when the packet was already completed and submitted to XXXX for review? I have a mountain of documentation from Greentree that I 've been collecting since XXXX of 2014 with all the communications that show they were pursuing foreclosure and the short sale at the same time a third department was continuing to ask me for my mortgage payments. The few times I contacted my assigned customer account rep they did n't even know what was going on with my account. I had to tell them to look in the computer to see what it says for my account. And then they acknowledged that my attorney 's name and my real estate agent 's name was in the computer and that I 'm pursuing a short sale. They would automatically call me to harass me for money without even looking at the account info to see that I was pursuing a short sale. Last week I received a complete packet from Greentree with options for staying in my home or leaving my home and avoiding foreclosure. I have n't been in my home for the past year and a half and I 've been working with Greentree for the past year or more and this packet they just sent me is starting the process from the beginning like they have n't been working with me. I 'm stuck in an endless loop with Greentree. I do n't understand why this type of behavior is legal. I pursued the short sale due to personal and financial hardship	1
but not without trying to tack on their exorbitant rates.	1
but not written notice and he was entitled to sixty days. This situation was explained to our loan officer and the final contract written "" tenant to remain in possession ''.	1
but nothing ever arrived in the mail. Also was told that the items would be removed from my credit during the investigation	1
but nothing had come out of my escrow. After my XXXX or XXXX call	1
but nothing in writing. Nationstar has sent nothing that would be a positive step in correcting the error and bringing our mortgage current. We are at the belief that this company has predatory lending practices	1
but nothing is happening with this collection agency.	1
but nothing resolved the problem.I had to call Macy 's every month to re-allocate the payments. I finally closed all accounts because of the frustration and because I knew that this would hurt my credit	1
but nothing was done. I have been at the same address for 19 years and I live at the property address that the mortgage is attached to. This is probably the most frustrating customer service issue I have ever encountered in my XXXX years on this planet.	1
but noticed they did not take the payment out as scheduled by XXXX/XXXX/2016. I called and was told that they have not received any funds and that I was a month past due. Consequently	1
but now I was threatened they would terminate my loan application if I do not respond within the next business day with info I gave them and my CPA	1
but now USAA does not care about their members anymore.	1
but now can get no information about whether someone has appropriated our identity to obtain loans. However	1
but now have {$4500.00} in fees added to the payments.	1
but now one can give me the report. Not for free not for a fee. PLease HELP	1
but now since I do n't have the card anymore and it 's no longer valid	1
but now since they have been charging me a late fee regardless	1
but now they are sitting on my FHA case # and not releasing it to my current lender	1
but now they are stating that they are not Green Tree. This can no longer continue. Deceptive business practices can never be tolerated!	1
but now they have dropped my credit score XXXX points because of it. Even though I am paying it on time	1
but now they need a copy of my social security card in order to mail file report. No one from Early Warning called/emailed me at any point to tell me they needed additional information ; I was originally told that all I need to submit was copy of DL	1
but now this company I have never heard of can. My attorney sent Cavalry 's collection law firm	1
but obviously that 's not the case here. I am furious and my Mother is elderly and sick and does not need this whatsoever. I am a grown adult and my finances and money troubles are my own.	1
but of course never did. It is convenient to them to keep my principal higher in order to charge me more interest. This first telephone call I made was on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Since then I was calling 2 times a week to see what has been done. So far nothing has been done and they just feeding me promises and telling how hard and how long it takes to transfer the money from one account to another. So now after a month I have no choice	1
but of the three people I spoke with	1
but offer no solution when that gets lost	1
but often times weeks after the date the statements indicate they were mailed.	1
but on the mortgage and my mother is the noteholder and stopped communicating with me. I have lived in the unit since owned in XXXX of XXXX. At the time of purchase my mom resided in a city owned apartment	1
but on the reports	1
but on their end they have ask and bid prices which are XXXX lot of time. I see them completing trades below the ask prices	1
but once we asked for all communication to be via email	1
but only after we felt we had to seek help elsewhere. We applied for modification in XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX	1
but only as XXXX separated flights : XXXX from XXXX to XXXX as a "" US to XXXX '' flight	1
but only modification	1
but only received letters and correspondence stating "" We require additional processing time to review your appeal ''. When I contacted the author of the letter today	1
but only recorded instructions. Please help me. Thanks!	1
but our credit union will not do it. I feel that XXXX seen my son as a young XXXX year old coming in there and they went to work on him	1
but our online access was restored. I still have online access	1
but over the past month	1
but paid as required every month. My wife lost job and I had to make some financial decisions. I am on a small SSI income. My first order of business was to find a way to get out from under this cycle. I found a program thru a debt relief XXXX. They contacted Advance to negotiate an agreement to paying off the loan. Advance refused to speak with them even under a POA. We could not understand why. XXXX contacted me and ask me to go in a request a rect of balance and fax it to them	1
but pay!	1
but paying out each month for gas {$100.00} and electricity {$50.00}. Believe I was finished with my electric setup/deposit in XX/XX/XXXX. But	1
but per my credit report	1
but please understand I 'm not one who asks for assistance in matters and I accept responsibility for mistakes when I make them. This however was not a mistake I made and its brutally unfair for me to have to pay for somebody else either purposely misrepresenting the truth or not doing their job. I have another issue with a repair request but I 'll put that in a separate complaint. Thank you for your time.	1
but prior to that transaction I have evidence that has come forth by way of collateral file. A Deed of trust from CountryWide Home Loans INC transferring all beneficial interests to XXXX XXXX as trustee for the note the date this occured was XX/XX/XXXX. along with this DOT was a allonge endosed to XXXX XXXX.	1
but proceeded to tell me only 9 days after statement that was sent	1
but put a note on the bottom stating I was signing under duress as I was told this would be a principal reduction. It was a standard modification. They called and told me they could not accept this with the note and would not do the mod with the note. They said they would send XXXX more forms for the original mod agreement. After 5 days I called and they said they had sent it. The woman I spoke with	1
but quickly changed there statement when I provided documentation from XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming the payment. A copy of my documents was provided as requested so the corrections can be made to my credit report. I was instructed contact Santander on XXXX/XXXX/2015 to confirm that the changes have been made. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 Santander stated that they are not going to change the report because it was not there fault that they credited the account on XXXX/XXXX/2015 instead on XXXX/XXXX/2015. They stated that the information was not enough to support my request.	1
but rather a 5 year interest only payment arrangement. During this time I was out of town for work	1
but rather the circumstances surrounding it. He had contacted his credit card and student loan	1
but reached out to XXXX for refinance options when our savings was almost exhausted. We were told that despite credit scores over XXXX	1
but received little to now cooperation. XX/XX/XXXX payment was collected of which Drive Time did not give me credit for and showed my car as being repossessed. At this point I requested an Audit of my account and after 3 months	1
but received no reply. ProCollect has phoned many times ( not less than XXXX times ) and has sent many letters ( not less than XXXX ) to my deceased wife regarding this debt. The actions by ProCollect are a violation of the Federal Fair Debt Collection Act.	1
but recently I discovered the debt has been transferred to a different debt collection agency.	1
but refused to give her my DL #. I hung up after she refused to so many tries. The next time I call	1
but refused to give me documentation. I attempted to explain to XXXX XXXX that as a consumer I have a right to ask for documentation. He became irritated stating that I was listening and hung up on me. When dealing with the Credit bureau it is always best to have documentation to ensure that the correct information is shared.	1
but refuses to acknowledge that I have repeatedly sent them the correct documents to support my dispute. Experian has locked me out of my online report	1
but rejected the letter. The Chase representative could not answer why the letter was rejected. This error has resulted in my mortgage payment being almost doubled and has created a great hardship for my household. I have XXXX children under the age of XXXX and my husband 's salary is our only source of income.	1
but requests for proof that is my debt and when this debt was last paid	2
but requiring an auction to uncover other buyers and "" true market value. '' That complaint was # XXXX.	1
but roughly a week later (XX/XX/XXXX) they charged my credit card $XXXX without any notification or authorization from me."	1
but said he would check with his supervisor. When he came back on phone	1
but said they could put a hold on the foreclosure proceedings since we signed contract to sell. They sent us a payoff but it was only good till XXXX XXXX. Fast forward to XXXX and we called to let them know that with money from family we were actually paying the loan in full with the applicable per diem interest and would be sending it overnight. Unfortunately we got a letter from an Attorney the same day	1
but said to remove the PMI I 'd have to pay {$500.00} for a new appraisal.	1
but sent me another statement claiming I owed {$580.00} for the XX/XX/XXXX payment	1
but seriously lowers my credit score since debt to available credit is now a much higher percentage. Credit card companies should not be able to do this to hurt consumers. American express did this to me once before back in 2008 during the financial crisis. I have never been late or missed a payment on ANY of my credit cards or other credit related instruments in 17 years	1
but she could n't provide anymore information because they were still having technical difficulties with their system. But however she assured me that within 3 business days my money would be back in my account	1
but she emailed us and said we were good. That was one issue. Then on the day I was originally suppose to close	1
but she has her own bills and she is not on the mortgage. My income is {$XXXX} per month	1
but she has yet reached back to me to respond.	1
but she just keeps yelling and hangs up on me. The notice ( "" Account Status '' ) was sent to me after I requested a copy of the bill or explanation of charges over the phone	1
but she would n't do it because she did n't think I needed help. My second question was about extended repayment and received different answers once again from both employees. Both calls made me feel like the people working for Sallie Mae are n't concerned with the well-being of those who have loans through their company.	1
but showing it as XXXX accounts - and it 's been paid for XXXX years. That 's XXXX extra accounts showing on my credit report that should n't be there. And it 's on XXXX reports that I got XXXX XXXX Equifax XXXX	1
but so far	1
but some one has to care enough to get to the bottom of all of this we are now out of money do to all the attorney fees so far and we still have no answers because it never went to court with our evince the Judge did a summary judgment which was never asked for. So if there is any thing you can do for us to find out where the XXXX loan money went if it did not pay off our home. Please help us! We wrote Senator XXXX and he his the one who told us to get ahold of you for help.	1
but somehow the company found a way to keep charging my account. This is tantamount to fraud.	1
but someone that needs to sale it for hardship and MY FATHER NEEDS IT!! i do not want to go out and buy a {$30000.00} car for someone that is as sick as my father is. Then i will be XXXX of these people that ca n't sale it to anyone BECAUSE banks wont loan on them.	1
but specifically requested to not have checks or a debit cards issued. I wanted to withdraw cash directly. TCF Bank proceeded to assess a fee for checks I did not order ( they reversed the fees after I complained ) and apparently issued a debit card for the account which I do not remember ever receiving.	1
but split : $ {$2000.00} effective XXXX/XXXX/2015 applied as my advance XXXX payment	1
but still	2
but still being polite i explain there has to be something else that can be done because if it takes that long my loan would be past due 22 days and after 15 days of being past due	1
but still no debt validation. I do n't owe this debt and they keep harassing me and everyone I know but using different phone numbers. You block one and the spawn another.	1
but still nothing. Since they XXXX took additional funds out of my account it has been nearly XXXX months and they have yet to refund a XXXX dollar or make any effort to even though they admit to owing me the money.	1
but still potential impacts were shared. Later in the day	1
but store staff in brooks brother told me that they can not make sure the account came up on their system is mine. I made {$100.00} payment to try. Next statement I received	1
but that 's not a reason enough to rectify but rather use it as an "" business opportunity '' to "" extort '' fees and money from a Citizen of Florida. Even further threaten to "" mar '' and "" damage '' a persons credit that can be damaging to a persons credit score over false inaccurate information that smells awfully opportunistic. Once I figured out what was going on here and after speaking to Florida XXXX XXXX	1
but that I still wanted a copy of my loan paperwork	1
but that I would appreciate it if they did not call multiple times in a row. I was responsive to their calls and did make a substantial payment in response	1
but that I would get a return of 7.5 % /yr to 12.50 % /yr depending on the stock performance. There were XXXX stocks in the portfolio. Therefore	1
but that XXXX XXXX who charged off the debt in XX/XX/XXXX	1
but that account was closed XXXX so it could not have been used. NPGLLC has called my husband and father in law and left them threatening messages. I have confirmed with the FCC that this is indeed a known scam and I wish to file a formal claim.	1
but that her system failed when trying to give me a confirmation number. Said XXXX XXXX who is the ONLY XXXX in Consumer Relations	1
but that is incorrect : we always pay the principal in advance - industry-wide practice. Thus	1
but that it 's under 30 days past due and not incurring these fees for no reason	1
but that it was never a document that needed my signature. How can they add such a fee without my agreeing to that? This is completely unfair practice that before I have seen a XXXX statement I can be charged a total of {$130.00} in fees ; {$100.00} of those that I was never told about. I cancelled my account and will never do business with them again	1
but that it was only good for 30 days so we would probably have to submit another balance transfer request. I did as I was told and requested another balance transfer via the First Tennessee website on XXXX/XXXX/2015.	1
but that replacement had the same issue & I refused it. I wrote XXXX letters to Sears : the first to the CEO	1
but that the box was still on my account. They gave me a number to call which was just a recording saying they would respond within XXXX hours. They did not respond.	1
but that the charge would stay on my account. They refused to give me the benefit of the doubt during a very lengthy investigation period of 2-3 months. Meanwhile	1
but that the representative would initiate a request. When I told the representative that I needed information immediately as my payment was due	1
but that they do n't have a paper-copy option for their online checking account. I was told that I had opted out when I opened the account ( this is mandatory )	1
but that they would accept it as a XXXX time courtesy.	1
but that they would not send me an email confirmation	1
but that was not true.	1
but that wo n't happen. We 've called Wells Fargo & XXXX ( owns our mortgage loan ) and we keep getting the run around. Wells Fargo says to call XXXX	1
but the Account History section is blank	1
but the Amortization Schedule they sent shows no increase in interest rate. In fact the Amortization Schedule they sent shows our interest rate remaining 2.625 % through the last payment in XX/XX/XXXX. Please make Ocwen follow our modification and keep our interest rate at 2.625 % till the end of our mortgage. A XXXX point increase could very well price us out of our home	1
but the FDCPA.	1
but the XXXX mortgage holder	1
but the account is showing the next payment due is {$570.00} on XXXX XXXX	1
but the amount listed in the "" BALANCE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE '' table was now {$4100.00} instead of {$4000.00}. I wrote two more letters of complaint. These were mailed and submitted online. I got an online message with a local number to call. After numerous phone calls	1
but the associate who was the originator of the loan assured us that that would n't be a problem because they do have XXXX speaking employees and that she used to work in XXXX XXXX for the bank were we had our bank account. By the beginning of the loan application we set XXXX XXXX as the closing date. The mortgage was being handled by an associate since the beginning of the application	1
but the automated calls continue. In talking to the representative over the phone	1
but the automated phone system would not recognize my social or loan number i provided and I got stuck in a loop. After this I decided to wait until the XXXX and try to pay online. This morning I tried setting up a new user account on HomeBridge 's website and it keeps telling me that they do n't recognize my information. I then tried again to call and after XXXX minutes of trying to get through the automated system	1
but the bank will of course accelerate the loan and will trigger the due on sale clause. At this stage they also want to charge me a prepayment penalty. We can not afford to sell the building and pay approx {$18000.00} in a prepayment penalty. Kind of like a Catch 22 situation.	1
but the beneficiary refused. I do n't think a wire should be able to go through if the name and address that are referenced are not those associated with that account. There should be some sort of verification process that keeps that from happening. I am now scammed out of {$1000.00} and a place to stay on our vacation.	1
but the check I attached clearly shows a payment of {$730.00}.	1
but the company ( Ocwen ) has not been responding or telling me what to do. They are acting as if they are drawing out the process so that I have to continue paying PMI even though I do not have to. I have already paid my XXXX payment	1
but the company says they ca n't find the information and must review it	1
but the company waited to charge my account until the product had shipped. I assumed I may be charged a overdraft fee for this mistake and rightly so	1
but the courts denied the request and sent me a letter signed by Judge XXXX XXXX entered XXXX stating I am to pay {$570.00} starting XXXX to Bank of America. Since the {$790.00} was not paid per XXXX they held my payments each month until enough was in my account to cover that amount then reported me to the credit bureaus as being late from XXXX until XXXX which is wrongfully reported. I started contacting Bank of America back in XXXX to ask them where I should start sending my payments and per their records I was still in bankruptcy to send it to my trustees office. I called back again in XXXX and XXXX advising them I needed the information to send my payments and was advised they still had me reflected in bankruptcy. I utilized my XXXX XXXX online bank pay to send the payments and have a track record proving I sent my {$570.00} payments on time and I advised them that they had the wrong tax information reported on my home and that my homeowners insurance policy information was wrong. The customer service representative stated I needed to contact my attorney and then contact XXXX because my policy went from {$1400.00} to {$2300.00}. I did just that and contacted Bank of American back to advise them that they were reporting me to wrongfully and penalizing me for their wrong information as well as XXXX XXXX XXXX mistake. XXXX XXXX XXXX backdated their mistake and fixed the policy	1
but the credit to my account remains as a temporary dispute credit for an indeterminate amount of time. Spoke with a XXXX XXXX	1
but the customer service rep said she was n't allowed	1
but the customers CAN NOT. Imagine how much money is involved if it turns out that they do this collectively on a regular	1
but the debt is not mine. This is just a scheme to collect the debt and they do n't care who they collect it from. I want them to cease and desist contacting me.	1
but the fax phone just rang and never picked up. I am going to try scanning and emailing	1
but the forced transfer of {$140.00} on XXXX XXXX was done without my permission and to my detriment as I have other	1
but the information is incorrect	2
but the information remains the same as previous.	1
but the junk mail continues to pour in to this day. It 's a terrible waste of resources and needs to stop.	1
but the last report date is still XX/XX/XXXX. I am seeking to have the last reported date to be set to its original state of XX/XX/XXXX. This error makes it look like the item was just processed. I discovered this after being denied credit	1
but the lender almost screwed up the deal as they refused to send the appropriate payoff paperwork to the attorney and the title company. In addition to that	1
but the listed charges that were later listed as points and loan origination charges were listed as 'settlement charges ' and since he told me there were no points and the only bank fee was ~ {$1000.00}	1
but the loan mod never came. I eventually hired an attny to help in getting Chase to mod my loan. The attny took my money	1
but the made no attempt to pay. 2nd there is a XXXX XXXX account in my name but it 's in IOWA	1
but the man with whom I had been living had made arrangements with the XXXX XXXX to remove my name from the account as well as pay the outstanding balance. The balance was much lower than Professional Credit Services ( PCS ) are claiming and was paid in full.	1
but the mortgage company is foreclosing on the land which was deeded over to me while my mother could still sign documents for herself.	1
but the most importance overall is putting a smile on my daughter 's face for her XXXX birthday this Friday ( XXXX XXXX ) ... .. I 'm having XXXX as I know & feel I still wo n't be able to access my funds yet another week : ' ( XXXXPlease help me!!!!!!!!	1
but the name and address on the document are not mine but "" XXXX XXXX '' with an address in XXXX	1
but the net only pertains to what my employer paid me by check for my base pay.This is an error in underwriting and my attorney has pointed this out to a manager at Nationstar. The manager agreed with me and sent my file back to underwriting stating an error was made in the review and that my net income used in the review excluded my tips which should have been used. My net income is not XXXX per month but closer to XXXX. Underwriting came back stating they were not going to correct the error and they are still denying me and refusing to even look at the issue. They state the decision stands and they refuse to correct my net income to what shows on my pay stubs. This is ridiculous and I can only come to the conclusion this is being done on purpose to evade reviewing me for assistacn save my home. My tips are shown as a deduction to my gross monthly income because my job does not pay me my tips. I receive them in cash while working. It is common sense that there is no way someone can have a gross monthly income of XXXX and a net income of XXXX. There is obviously something missing. It 's my tips!!!!! I was told I was denied for a loan modification because my net income is too low and I am unable to service my debt/expenses. This is not true. My servicer is ignoring my tips on my pay stubs when calculating my net income. I am not sure why they refuse to count my tips in my net income. They show on my pay stub and we have explained this to a manager named XXXX ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ) who also agrees with us. This is the second time Nationstar 's incompetent underwriting refuses to count my tips toward my net income. They count it toward my gross income. It 's not complicated and I believe Nationstar is simply doing this to purposely evade reviewing me for assistance. This is the second time I am applying for assistance and the second time Nationstar refuses to properly underwrite my paystubs.	1
but the next successor trustee might not be so fortunate. Wells Fargo should not be able to get away with this again. I would like to know if what they did was illegal	1
but the next year we start all over with the bank adding yet another policy to the mortgage. This has been going on for 5 years.	1
but the offer code was XXXX.	1
but the other company offered to give me copies of documents I already had for a {$100.00} fee. I believe it was either the deed or the promissory note. If I had the letter	1
but the part I 'm contacting you about is the failure to communicate. I 've been asking for months	1
but the payment that was provided was close to half of my monthly income. Not only that	1
but the payments are not being credited	1
but the payments we sent to XXXX XXXX Mortgage and to Nationstar Mortgage was never applied to our loan. Further	1
but the phone number had been disabled. I was instructed to contact the Customer Relationship Manager. I spoke to the CRM	1
but the phone rep from XXXX XXXX XXXX repeatedly tells me that they are in no way	1
but the primary mortgage is still not accurate. There is a missing payment of XXXX that was provided and cleared by my bank XXXX XXXX	1
but the problem was not corrected. XXXX sent over a unqualified person to work on my toilet. He could not fix the problem and had to call in support to help him replace a simple flush valve. Not only did this operation take two hours	1
but the question is why would that deposit disappear when it was visible throughout the day as well as the XXXX charge. I have gotten XXXX overdrafts this week for moving money from my basic checking to the Hassle Free account which is my son 's account. They are both my accounts. I should not be penalized for moving my money around between accounts. So on XX/XX/XXXX I started the day with a positive balance and ended the day with a positive balance having deposited XXXX into my account. Yet I bounced XXXX items	1
but the real shoe dropped the following week : the dealership Fed exed to my work a change in the interest rate to 25 %. Since I could n't return the vehicle and was living on XXXX income and no child support as a single parent	1
but the refrigerator was never shipped and therefore	1
but the request has been ignored. I presume the agency thinks we are deadbeats requesting a stop to collections activities when in fact we are NOT the rightful owners of this debt. Failure to cease communication upon written request is a violation of FDCPA. We request this agency cease and desist from sending letters to our address. I also have UDAAP concerns about the letters. The letters do not name the creditor and just say "" Time Sensitive Document ''. The most recent letters are yellow envelopes inside of a white envelope with a clear panel on the outside envelope	1
but the series of errors that SPS made and then refused to address or correct. SPS keeps stating that the only issue was their overdraft of my account which took place under authority I extended them back in XXXX. If this was truly the case	1
but the situation worsens because I have to wait an additional 18 months because of this card that was activated for a minute	1
but the system was not allowing him. He even mentioned that it analysis the overall relationship and was declining his request at this time	1
but the way Wells Fargo has treated me	1
but the withdrawal was delayed through no fault of mine or my bank ( XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX. Nevertheless	1
but their XXXX number was busy.	1
but their automated help system was less than helpful to say the least.	1
but their department was delayed in processing the request. I advised them that I can not be penalized for their error. They then stated that records indicated that they did have it	1
but their lawyer can not ethically and professionally speak to a represented person.	1
but their unanimous response was "" this is not how we do it ''.	1
but then SunTrust charged me {$15.00} separately for a "" domestic '' wire transfer. SunTrust publishes an incoming international wire transfer fee of {$30.00}. When I questioned the double charge XXXX {$30.00} off the top and {$15.00} extra )	1
but then decided that I did not think that this was wise	1
but then included a XXXX processing fee each month totaling {$130.00} for 6mths XXXX payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX ask me for my card info	1
but then it was still denied	1
but then just close my account out of the blue without compensating me for the value of the rewards that I earned. Barclay 's website states that you can "" redeem your miles for travel statement credits	1
but then stated they would send an email and try to stop it. I was told this on XXXX XXXX	1
but then terminated the contract with no reason on XX/XX/XXXX. We got the house back on the market as quickly as we were able. After several attempts	1
but then they have nothing regarding. After numerous calls and runarounds	1
but then they refused to make the modification permanent!!	1
but then they returned it to XXXX. They explained that they "" had '' to raise it again because lowering it was just temporary. Since that time	1
but then they say that more documents are needed	1
but then they tell me it 's not.	1
but then they turned it over to Convergent	1
but then told me it would be XXXX. I had picked a base modelthat only had some cosmetic changes like flooring and cabinet color. Thehouse was framed when I started losing hours and was afraid of losing my job.	1
but then we started getting notices in the mail that we were in default of our loan.. I called and after a very confusing conversation with a foreign person I had a hard time understanding	1
but then when I call back to confirm	1
but there "" claims department '' website. Without any warning and and hardly no communication between the merchant	1
but there are no options to upload the docs on their website. Called again	1
but there is no way to reach them except by snail mail. The company 's refusal to provide me any information is unacceptable	1
but there was an additional step required to accept ). The credit limit was much lower than made sense	1
but there was not an option for this online. I contacted the telephone number listed on the website and was assured that the account would be closed and that no further information would be disseminated to any lender. As a consumer	1
but these XXXX Experian is still report this account on my credit file. I 've spoken with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that they 've sent me and verbally spoken with me and assured me that they are not reporting this account with Experian and NO other XXXX	1
but these people are falsely stating that I do.	1
but these people are good ... .and they talked me into going with them. The process dragged on and on and on ... ... and I really do n't think that Loan Depot steals money from anyone	1
but they 'd "" go missing	1
but they 're not holding up their side of the bargain by making all of my statements available online. Please help. Thank you.	1
but they actually have not. To date I still do not have any letters of receipt of application/denial or approval. Then on XXXX/XXXX/2015 my attorney spoke with CMG Financial and they stated my loan modification request was denied on XXXX 2015 due to liens on my title. I was not given the opportunity to appeal my denial before the 30 days period after my denial because CMG Financial withheld the denial letter and would not accept calls and did not return messages during this time. It is apparent they did this on purpose solely to evade allowing me to appeal my denial. I have a valid appeal as I have cleared my title and I am certain I qualify for assistnace. I feel my servicer purposely withheld my denial letter	1
but they all require a decent credit score. I have terrible credit as a result of student loans	1
but they also precluded me from the right to appeal for funds to complete work on my property by demanding repetitive forms	1
but they also talked down to him threatening to take everything from him and told him he was n't allowed to call them more than three times a day ( after they continuously hung up on him and I ) and then when we could get ahold of them	1
but they are closed.	1
but they are coming.	1
but they are making it my problem. If I do n't get a satisfactory result I 'm hiring an attorney and going to every news and social media regarding the practices of this financial institute and how the government agencies who are suppose to keep them in line are not.	1
but they are no longer in business. I also have not worked since 2011 and have lived in XXXX since then	1
but they are not bound to the information their representatives are giving and that i owe this money. I asked how could this be that in the store where they deal directly 100 % of the time with the customers	1
but they are not calling the person	1
but they are not offering any purchase protection on their end as they promised me. I feel like I have been cheated and lied to regarding purchase protection.	1
but they are now reporting this debt on my credit report. I do not know how to make this stop or go away	1
but they are reporting that it was.The bk is also discharged now so even if the status changed DURING the bankruptcy	1
but they are stealing my REWARDS from me. I have excellent credit	1
but they are unable to keep up with the companies that are performing the scams. XXXX XXXX XXXX is trying to resolve a debt for {$430.00} and have been hanging up on me and not allowing me to dispute the claim	1
but they are unable to show me proof that I still had XXXX and they were rude to me.	1
but they are unwilling to correct their mistake. They acknowledge that by key strokes they can see that I attempted several times to log on between the XXXX of the month of XXXX and then not again until they contacted me on XXXX XXXX. This clearly is because I thought the payment went through. I have a long tenure with Chase and do not deserve to be treated in this manner. I pay my bills through internet bill pay every month and have never had a problem with the payment being processed. I simply ask them to correct this as a systemic error.	1
but they ca n't guarantee I am paying the arrears. I have also now been informed they have no wish to remove my forced escrow even through I gave them no reason to enact it in the first place. My taxes are not due in XXXX. It is my understanding the only way I can be forced into an escrow on an account without an escrow is if I am at risk for default. As I have always paid my own taxes at the same time every year and have never had a default against my property	1
but they ca n't state why. My insurance is XXXX per year. Then they sent me a refund of {$290.00} which I said I did not want and they said I had to cash the check. Now they say my escrow is negative Just that I have to pay the increased amount.	1
but they call my house at least 3-5 times a day	1
but they can vary widely. So meanwhile the lender has pulled your credit	1
but they choose not to do it in writing.	1
but they claim they did not receive the XXXX inquiry. Upon the XXXX attempt I called Umpqua again. I received the same response when I the XXXX time as I did the XXXX	1
but they continue to ignore my requests. My total estimated escrow payments for the year 2016 are {$9300.00}. They want to hold {$3100.00} in escrow which is exactly XXXX. The original amount without the increase would have been {$2200.00} which is still over the contracted amount even without the increase.	1
but they continue to send their invoices. Today	1
but they could n't have because I never would have agreed to it. I called and made a stink and only got {$100.00} back. This from someone who has XXXX bank accounts	1
but they could not explain why. It was balanced at the beginning of the year	1
but they denied my request along with all my previous requests for a forberance plan and repayment plan. I was denied of my legal right to bring my loan current. Instead	1
but they did have the correct bank account information. High Point Asset	1
but they did n't make steady or full payments. They did n't pay the escrow	1
but they did not apply the extra amount	1
but they did not informed XXXX	1
but they did not know where to apply it. Please note	1
but they did not send the XXXX on back. Received the XX/XX/XXXX XXXX back for {$250.00}. I have no money for needed items. Sincerely.	1
but they did.	1
but they didia random drive-by to try nd pick it up. When it was n't in front of the house	1
but they do n't even know who I am. This can not be a legitimate debt collector.	1
but they do n't look in the file to see I own the property ). I sent the Ombudsman papers in XX/XX/XXXX and she said I would be authorized in 2 days. I called today to ask why their statement shows XXXX cents in other fees	1
but they do not answer. We have had our attorney contact Bank of America and they basically denied any wrongdoing ; they claimed that this was due to XXXX XXXX XXXX and a missing assignment. It is not our fault if BOFA sold our loan to a third party or lost it. It has been over two years since we have paid off our loan and Nevada state law requires the owner to receive their title within 90 days of being paid off. We are worried we will never receive it.	1
but they do not care. The house was discharged in the bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX and the bank refuses to take ownership of the property so what am I to do?	1
but they do not recommend sending a check through the mail anymore. I should not have to go out of my way to make these payments because of their practices of holding payment checks until the XXXX of the month even though it was sent in plenty of time before due. I have XXXX accounts with Wells Fargo and I am going to seriously consider changing banks after 20 years of banking with them.	1
but they ended denying us and putting us back to apply for a modification. I would like for the lender to consider us for a principal reduction since I truly believe the arrears with have not been as high if the Servicer would had made a decision for a loan modification. It took them from XXXX to XXXX to finally approved me for a modification.	1
but they gave us wrong information. PLEASE HELP US	1
but they had apparently turned it over to a collection agency. To date XXXX has not corrected the problem. Poor customer service on XXXX 's part by not following up on their commitment.	1
but they have NEVER reviewed our loan for assistance. Unless they did it on their own. We are now in a situation where they are going to take our home away	1
but they have drug this out as my income has slowly increased and reducing my payment now would only result in a reduction of a few dollars - my ask is that this be done and that I be on a fixed rate loan	1
but they have gone back on their original terms and now say that we owe them {$240.00}.	1
but they have have not complied to my requests since they created their fictitious amount in XX/XX/XXXX. Please investigate this company and have them remove their account from my credit report and any associations with me.	1
but they have have not complied to my requests since they created their fictitious amount in XXXX. Please investigate this company and have them remove their account from my credit report and any associations with me.	1
but they have neglected to send me my title.	1
but they have neither sent me a copy or agreed to sendone to me. There are XXXX of people who have similar experienceswith Navient/XXXX XXXX that I found online. It 's time to stop them frombullying tactics.	1
but they have not agreed to do that. I feel this is a mis-application of my {$620.00} payment and I would like this corrected.	1
but they have not. All they do is leave threatening voicemails.	1
but they have refused to delay billing or adjust payment due date stating the problem is between the vendor and me.	1
but they have refused to remove the false item from my credit report ( which	1
but they have still denied my fraud claim and have reported the account as delinquent to at least Experian XXXX	1
but they involve Central Credit Services to harass the debtor.	1
but they keep the person paying their monthly fees. Very unethical. The Internet is filled with others who have the same issues.	1
but they kept on telling me that I did not win the case. At this point I really just need a refund as my credit card does n't even have a regular balance for {$2000.00}. I was told there is nothing I can do except contact the merchant for a refund on this issue. I went ahead and explained this issue to the company	1
but they mislead consumers in what they actually tell them regarding their balance transfer offers. Their claim of a 0 % interest balance transfer is misleading and deceptive because what they do not tell consumers is that you can not avoid interest charges unless you discontinue use of the card. US Bank did apparently remove the interest charges and I have discontinued use of the card	1
but they never did. All additional principal payments never went to principal	1
but they oddly have no records of it. I chatted in a month or two ago to confirm ( but chat was a separate issue ) and they confirmed I 'd receive double cashback XX/XX/XXXX. I called in today and was told the same as yesterday. All I want is the promotion I was promised months ago.	1
but they only allow me to make and or schedule payments equivalent to what THEY declare is my "" current balance ''. If I charge {$300.00} on my card on a given day	1
but they refuse to do the right thing and let me the consumer suffer.. Please people do not allow your family to do business with Quicken Loans!!	1
but they refuse to remove the late payment from my credit. I have filed a complaint with the XXXX and now with you. Please let me know if I can get any help with this problem. I still have the note that they sent with my check and will try to get a copy of the check ( I deposited the check to cover resending the payment ).	1
but they refuse to take any action. Thus	1
but they refused to credit the late fee	1
but they refused to listen to me. I physically had my insurance agent on the phone to explain to the mortgage company that they NEVER received any recent correspondence from the insurance company as the policy was not due for a few months. THe mortgage company said they would check into it	1
but they refused to verify they received it. It is now XXXX XXXX and today HMF told him it would be 3 more business days from receipt of additional information that they once again will not confirm they received. I faxed them this morning demanding escalation and a call from management by XXXX	1
but they refused. I felt that as a XXXX Veteran they would oblige a lower rate after I asked. They did not. My account with them has since been closed as of XXXX XXXX. I am filing this complaint because I believed that Navy Federal could have reduced my 18 % to a more manageable rate as I was in troubled financial times.	1
but they report us to the credit bureaus ( I have written XXXX	1
but they said they do not provide amortization charts. How am I supposed to plan without knowing how long I will have to pay my loan	1
but they say they will not move forward with the assumption modification until Probate documents are received. Probate is an expensive process	1
but they seem to want to drag this out as long as possible. The agents at Wells Fargo have lied to us and even went so far as to tell me about her son being XXXX from the military. I have spoken to their executive office and got no resolution. I feel I have done everything to try to save this property	1
but they stated they would not remove me from this re-occurring service. I am therefore reporting this as fraud.	1
but they still new we had an offer. We just kept plugging along trying to get seller pre-approval. On XXXX after being told when I called in several updates by WF that the file had already been sent to FHA for final review	1
but they still wo n't give me the money. I have contacted them XXXX times and they have promised me the money by a certain date twice	1
but they told me that they would need a letter from me requesting the inquiries be removed as well as a letter from XXXX on company letter head or an email. I got an email from XXXX requesting the inquiries be removed and I typed a letter which I immediately sent to Transunion so the inquires can be removed	1
but they took almost 50 % of the monies I paid in.	1
but they were not accepted. I sent them back to my grandfather and he attempted to have them deposited into his account at XXXX	1
but they were posted as late payments	3
but they were willing to mail me or download my Credit Report for a fee of {$7.00}. As if is n't enough that Experian reports wrong items in XXXX % of Consumer 's Credit Reports	1
but they will NOT cease their collection efforts.	1
but they will also have my name on record as poa	1
but they will not confirm this to the credit agencies. My new home is ready to move into	1
but they will not help me rehabilitate or discuss anyway to get this removed from collections besides paying off the amount ( at 50 % charge off discount. ) I would immediately get a personal loan for XXXX to pay it off	1
but they will not listen and will hold my money for 6 months.	1
but they will only accept a revolving bank statement as proof. My bank does not provide such a statement. I have sent them 3 months worth of bank statements so that they could trace my balances themselves if they think that I was somehow manipulating the data on the XXXX statement. I have also provided a copy of a screen shot of the payment that my bank provided to me when I went into the branch to get proof of the payment. They are extremely uncooperative and rude to me when I try to get this resolved. I have sent information to them on XXXX occasions and made XXXX phone calls and still it has been over 3 months and it is not resolved. This is affecting my credit and they keep charging me late fees and continue to make harrassing phone calls to my home. I just do not know what else I can do at this point. I have now had to contact an attorney for help in getting this cleared up.	1
but they wo n't be applied until they are due. Thus	1
but they work with XXXX companies so i may not know the name specifically. They identified on this last call as XXXX or XXXX XXXX XXXX and i was talking to the location in XXXX. I spoke with XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX spoke with my daughter the day before and told her i was in serious financial trouble. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX she told me there is a civil complaint filed against me for XXXX pending charges of Breach of Contract and Intent to Defraud a Financial Institution. I asked her if it was filed with a court. When i asked where the complaint was filed she hung up on me. Prior to that they told me the statute of limitations had expired for this so by law they had to lower the debt. Stating that the original loan was {$500.00}	1
but they would allow it to be a short sale.	1
but they would have XXXX call me. Nobody ever called me or tried to help at all. I finally called and told them to take the account off auto pay since nobody there cared to fix the problem. I have had service with XXXX for many years and I always had them on auto pay so there was never a late payment. I never pay any of my bills late. I literally spent hours and hours on the phone over the course of several months trying to get someone there to care enough to help. I do not owe them any money and am disputing that any negative information on my account is incorrect. Thanks to their lack of caring or helping	1
but they would n't close PMI in escrow. I called numerous times about this matter	1
but they would n't say. At this point	1
but they would not put that in writing. The underwriting team from XXXX XXXX XXXX would not release funds without it being in writing for fear that Ocwen would reject the EFT. Because Ocwen kept transferring us to the wrong department all along and they will not submit the correct paperwork	1
but they would not tell me ; they just said I would not be awarded the bonus points.	1
but they would still deny the claim. This is in direct violation of a Regulation E of the Electronics Funds Act.	1
but this account has already been closed since 2012. This account has been closed for XXXX years and they are now reporting on my credit I have a recent late payment. Their are reporting inaccurate and derogatory information on my credit file. Please remove the unverifiable derogatory information from my credit file. It has been over XXXX days. This information must be removed or I will escalate to the FTC.	1
but this document indicated that the lender credit had been reduced because of the cost of the rate lock extension. I immediately asked my loan processor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX who advised me not to worry	1
but this has gone on too long. I did nothing wrong. I tried to contact them and they did not respond. I feel it was false	1
but this is still inaccurate based on the numbers from the default judgement. They also stated that they will still report to the XXXX credit reporting bureaus any account information. This furthers harms my credit because of the difference between the judgement and what Chase Bank discharged	1
but this is the first time I have been aware of the XXXX company.	1
but this is the second such incident I have encoutered with my current one. The call I am referring to took place on XXXX XXXX	1
but this is utterly ridiculous!!!	1
but this never happened.	1
but this occurs once to twice per day	1
but this past weekend we made and an offer and it was accepted. I contacted Wells Fargo this week and began the process. I communicated with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at Wells Fargo. We discussed having only me be on the loan since my wife has bad credit due to her ex-husband. He informed me to get a Good Faith Estimate for just myself he would need to run my credit again	1
but this time XXXX accounts were removed from my reports	1
but this time a lady left a name. She also said that she was calling from a locator service. She said her name is XXXX XXXX	1
but this unethical and it is purposefully setup to maximize fees and hurts the consumer in almost all cases	1
but those XXXX payments should still not be on my credit report.	1
but those of her daughter and grandson. He needs to follow up on his word and take the hold off of the safety deposit box immediately. He is an unethical attorney who preys on the most vulnerable and he should be sanctioned for his tactics. His company is called Legal Recovery XXXX and is located in XXXX XXXX. After a year has passed with nothing done to release the safety deposit box	1
but those payments were rejected. Carrington will only accept full payment of the arrearage. I have escrowed those payments	1
but those records are no longer in existence. and if that is the case	1
but to another client. The manager just said we ca n't do nothing and we are sorry. I went ahead as I did n't know what to do and paid a bill that it is not even mine	1
but to be charged over 10 times the amount I fell behind does not seem fair at all. I believe Citi is taking advantage of people in difficult situations. I am out of the mess I was in and have been current on my payments. I just ca n't seem to fathom making 40 years of payments. Citi did n't offer the XXXX XXXX XXXX Program to me despite receiving government money. The XXXX Mod that they offered was an in house loan mod program and I believe it is truly taking advantage of people in similar situations. Citi should be held responsible for their actions.	1
but to call back in 3-4 weeks to verify. Again	1
but to continue try and prove that by their mistakes and unwillingness to get this problem resolved. I will continue to address this the best I can	1
but to my father	1
but to my knowledge	1
but to no avail	1
but to no avail. I 've sent them supporting evidence	1
but to no avail. I eventually got fed-up with Wells Fargo and asked to close my account and get a refund of the balance which was in excess of {$2000.00}. The account was asked to be closed over 1 month ago	1
but to the house ( which is rental property ). Also	1
but to us ( XXXX and XXXX XXXX )	1
but to wait until I moved out before doing so.	1
but today I received a bill for the charge we specifically discussed on the XXXX. Today is XXXX XXXX	1
but together with my ( at the time ) husband	1
but told the agent I needed to confirm with my son and might again cancel this reservation. They seemed to understand. The next day	1
but took the easy route and placed it on my credit report instead of investigating the validity of account before the date of the letter prior to placing this bogas debt on my credit. This is a bogus claim from XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have been making attempts to contact this collection agency withing the 30 day time frame to find out why are they contacting me with a debt to collect with incorrect information and wrong amount of what is owed to XXXX XXXX XXXX reporting the incorrect amount ; When in fact I notified the company to fix the problem to terminate service and adjust my bill which never was completed.. Each month they would overcharge me	1
but totally unacceptable behavior.	1
but tried to blame that on us instead of taking responsibility and fixing it ). They even sent our case to their collections department	1
but two days before that i had a voicemail from bank of the west saying they sent the title out already. I 've been getting blown off by everybody i call with a different story everytime at this branch as well. The bank of the west branch is located at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX	1
but ultimately the loan was put into foreclosure. I was finally able to pay the balance	1
but under my explanation of amount where it says escrow	1
but until now I have not received anything from them. They placed lien on my property in XXXX and XXXX but failed because the SSN who owes the debt was not mine. They also tried to foreclose on my property thereafter	2
but usually no bill will come. I think they intentionally want me to forget to make my monthly payment so they can collect the late fee.	1
but validated. I asked that their office provide me with competent evidence that I have any legal obligation to pay them. I requested that they send me the following items : What the money you say I owe is for ; provide a detailed list of any and all services or goods purchased and a line by line itemization of charges.	1
but wanted my husband 's last XXXX digits of his social security number and his date of birth	1
but wanted to make sure others are aware of the fraud occurring at this bank. ( and this is not the first time this has occurred )	1
but wanted to resolve the issue. They would not take partial payment as they wanted me to repay the XX/XX/XXXX payment. I called yesterday to pay the entire amount	1
but was denied because they told me that I had caused a loss at another financial organization. Bank of America never said anything about any loss and there was none. I have attempted to open accounts at several other banks but have been refused there as well. All of this has ruined my financial credit. I did absolutely nothing wrong and am being punished for something that some internet hacker did to me. I need to get an account with a bank because all that I have now is a reloadable debit card with XXXX XXXX XXXX and this is not adequate for all of my needs. I have a lot of documents explaining everything that happened	1
but was denied by XXXX based on their appraised value of {$44000.00}. We have opened a separate complaint against XXXX based on this appraisal	1
but was never able to reach that department. I tried the following XXXX numbers : 1 ) ( XXXX XXXX XXXX 2 ) ( XXXX XXXX XXXX 3 ) ( XXXX XXXX XXXX The first phone number appears on the credit report. The person I spoke with at that number gave me the XXXX and XXXX numbers. XXXX of the XXXX people said that an investigation had concluded that the {$42.00} was not the result of fraudulent charges. I said that	1
but was never called back to resolve the issue. I never opened or used any of the product.	1
but was never contacted back. To me I suspect that BofA is committing this fraud with a lot of their customers hoping that the customers do n't check their statement close enough.	1
but was never provided XXXX. We then sent a letter stating that we would be initiating a civil proceedings to get the things we need and to pursue civil penalties. We were contacted by an attorney who threatened to sue us and take us to court if we pursued civil action against them. Through out contacts with the attorney we requested a itemized copy of our final statement. He agreed and sent the request on XX/XX/XXXX. I have attempted to follow up with XXXX XXXX XXXX on several different occasions with the most recent occurring on XX/XX/XXXX in regards to a statement and itemized bill. The leasing consultant refused and stated that she could not help me. The collection agency stated that they are no responsible for the balance and the contract is now between Rent Recovery Solutions and myself. They stated that the balance is due to them.	1
but was never sure if it was a loan or a credit card. The original amount of the loan was for {$10000.00} and I was charged an interest rate of 17.90 % with a monthly payment of {$290.00}. If it was a loan then the interest should have been included in the monthly payment and if it was a credit card	1
but was not able to get anyone to understand my complaint.	1
but was not mailed until XXXX XXXX in the mail stating my modification was declined because I did not accept the agreement. This was a flat out lie. By the time the paperwork came	1
but was not making any sense. I	1
but was not willing to pay a fee. She then typed on the computer and told me a new card would be mailed	1
but was then told I was approved for a repayment plan	1
but was told by the same rep ( whose name I did not get ) that they would just cancel the ACH form and I could pay online into which steps I have listed above. To add I was not told by the dealership XXXX ( XXXX ) or even MotoLease how the payments were to be made I had to research all of this information for myself.	1
but was told he shall assume	1
but was told that I have stop my payment before the bank would even talk to me	1
but was told that I was inelgible to do so since I had already "" accessed '' my annual report.	1
but was told that because I did n't bank with XXXX that I would have to notify my bank and have them file the claim. After hanging up with XXXX I then called my bank ( Statefarm bank ) and explained the situation. A young lady handled the dispute and told me that a provisional credit would be put on my account for the amount of money I deposited	1
but was told that it would likely not work due to the fact that the funds were used for educational purposes. I feel as though I will never get out from under this	1
but was told that my payment was XXXX short due to an escrow shortage that they applied to my account effective XXXX XXXX. 2015	1
but was told that they were n't counting Friday the XXXX. I was told at that time we should have something between 3 to 5 business days. I called back on the XXXX whcih would be the fourth business day based on their calculations. I was again told that nothing has been done	1
but was told there was nothing to be done about it	1
but was told they had no record of this under my social security number and that the social listed on the application was different	1
but was unable to do so. At this point	1
but was unable to even get a loan for more that XXXX dollars because of the negative impact the Citi Student loans had on my credit score. They are unwilling to negotiate a lower payment amount and I ca n't find anyone that would even consider consolidating loans from them. Their associates are much less than pleasant to speak with and leave me feeling like I have no self worth after talking to them. Overall my college education feels like a disappointment because the job market is not that great	1
but was unable. As the executor of the estate	1
but we "" LOCKED IN '' with the first rate. We even asked her if the rate was good because of our good credit. She said "" yes. '' Two days later we got the written paper work	1
but we are now in need of some help ourselves. Due to some unfortunate circumstances and our lender 's unwillingness to cooperate	1
but we did n't have those. I asked again and he was rude and insisted and insisted on paystubs	1
but we did not do the photo shoot	1
but we get verification that they receive it thru e-mail. after a period of time they are asking for it again. These are the collection agency for XXXX XXXX that has the loan on the residence and property.	1
but we had been repeatedly asking for info from SunTrust regarding how much we would need to bring to avoid PMI or reduce PMI and had not had that information provided. He also stated we were set to close within the usual 60 days so we did n't need to be upset with how long the process was taking. We were then verbally told that the PMI company required new bank statements	1
but we had entered into a contract to sell the home. If they had done the job correctly and offered the options up front	1
but we have still struggled through XXXX. Our car was repossessed in XXXX XXXX. We explained the situation to WFDS	1
but we need help for the past months that we did n't have the income to pay it. It feels like they are playing games with us and setting us up to fail.	1
but we offered you XXXX Repayment Plans	1
but we were charged a XXXX fee of {$11000.00}! We felt as if we had no other option	1
but we were denied because of lack of income and the collateral was not sufficient. But we continued to pay our mortgage for the last 10 years and have never missed a payment until XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX our family encountered a true and devastating hardship. With a 2 day notice and no severance pay my husband lost his job of 15 years unexpectedly and through no fault of his own. We reached out to Astoria on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX and she reassured us that this happens and our payments would more than likely be reduced our rolled into the end of our loan. We were hopeful. We immediately filed paperwork with the Loss Mitigation Department at Astoria. We contacted the Hope hotline and talked with a counselor	1
but we were more forceful this time and did not allow he representative to do anything but cancel. We spoke over the agent with each continue pressure tactic and stated that we needed to cancel immediately. We had to repeat the request to cancel over XXXX dozen times to make sure the agent did not continue the refusals.	1
but we were not. They are also refusing to give us our down payment or the payments that we made back even though they told us and the dealership that they would do so since the loan was "" unwound ''. Now we are out of {$5000.00} and a car and Santandar said that it is our fault because we were not making payments. When I told them that I did what their agent told me to do they told me that they were sorry for the misinformation	1
but we were only given the run around. I had to figure out on my own that I was being over charged on the taxes. So I went to the tax offices that are involved	1
but went unanswered.	1
but were coming in the morning before anyone was at the building. We never saw them. I received the XXXX billing after cancellation in mid-XXXX 2013 and called again and left a message. They still continued to come through the end of the season. We have written letters and asked for these bills to be reversed. XXXX years later	1
but were never willing to help me with it.	1
but were stonewalled and given no information. We were told simply that this is the procedure and no further information is available. The inconvenience is in having to assemble and mail these documents	1
but were told that we should not have to spend the {$1000.00} to get it done as we are not on a flood plain. It was suggested that this is a scam being perpetrated on people who live in areas where there have been minor floods in the past year. None of our neighbors received anything from their mortgage companies and judging from the complaints filed against Nationstar	1
but were wanting to open a joint checking account. Moreover	1
but what can we do?	1
but what they did put my loan in foreclosure.before review my information	1
but when I answer the calls there is no one there and the call disconnects - this constitutes harassment. They also call at the same time every day ( between XXXX and XXXX	1
but when I called the travel center they informed me of all these change fees that included a {$270.00} airline per ticket fee and their service fee of {$30.00} per ticket. Even though the total price is now lower than what I originally paid for ( {$810.00} compared to {$1000.00} ) they will not refund me the difference or apply the credit to the airline penalty fee. They blamed the airline for these fees and for not refunding me the difference	1
but when I did not by XX/XX/XXXX end	1
but when I get me statement	1
but when I got to the store they said I could not return the defective product because it was not returned to them within 15 days. This is ridiculous because it was scrap that was delivered and not the product I had agreed to buy. I have extensive photographic evidence to verify this. I was told that Best Buy could have their XXXX XXXX refurbish the dishwasher-their words	1
but when I have been able to speak to a person	1
but when I have money to send them	1
but when I look on XXXX	1
but when I tried to withdraw money from the ATM it was declined. I tried again and it was declined. I logged onto the website and it said I had that much available	1
but when I went online to make payment today	1
but when everything went awry there was no communication at all. Then when they finally did send an email	1
but when the home was foreclosed	1
but when the phone was answered	1
but when they did call I was asked if I had the money yet. I asked why are you taking so long with the communication and did not receive any answers to that and scheduled me at another 4 week wait for a phone call from my relationship manager.	1
but when they realized that I was not the party responsible	1
but when transferred I was asked to enter an extension from the directory and the line disconnected. I was given no such information from the supervisor who transferred me.	1
but when we try to reply	1
but when you are on a budget you need every cent. I have since had my direct deposit stopped	1
but when you get ready to refi then it will help. We were n't talking about refinancing. We only wanted our first loan. This was a complete waste of our time and money as my DTI could n't sustain a jumbo anyway and XXXX knew it as I had DTI issues in the end and had to sale my car and pay XXXX to refinance which again cost us money.	1
but while I was waiting for their appraisal to come through they send a notice for rejection and by the time I received the notice	1
but will also prevent me from obtaining a HAMP 2MP loan modification on my XXXX mortgage.	1
but will mature in five years ( XX/XX/XXXX ). 2 1/2 - 3 years later	1
but will not draft a letter to that regard. They want our city to provide a form	1
but will not provide any information on what those charges are and how much? Can you help?	1
but will not stop the harrassing calls.	1
but with XXXX balance and it states that the last time it reported was on XXXX XXXX	3
but with a 4.125 % loan - fixed for 30 years	1
but with a chip.	1
but with a different date of birth and an address at which I have never resided. Thus confirming that DRS 's attempt to collect this debt from me is erroneous and baseless.	1
but with my bank account on the check	1
but with no ID she could donothing to access it. I offered to deposit some of the draftsinto my checking account and give her the cash when theycleared. Then I cashed XXXX checks totaling {$7000.00} over a XXXX dayperiod and the bank made the funds available the next day.	1
but with this set back and him having to attend a new college it will be two more months before he gets his money. I am asking capital one not to cancel the agreement	1
but wo n't help me stay in my house.	1
but wonder how many others are paying fees without knowing it.	1
but working less than 20 hrs. a week. I notified CHASE re : my employment situation immediately. I was told I can receive assistant for being laid off. I was out of work and finance from XXXX until XXXX. I received a full-time job XXXX making more XXXX hrs a week with benefits. I re-applied for the Hardest Hit Funds here in XXXX in XXXX. This program gives assistance to homeowners that are struggling with their mortgage with Hardship. I was approved of assistant from them of XXXX debt free	1
but would be generated by BoF. Whin I called BoF again	1
but would like a record of my payment history after each payment mailed my address.	1
but would listen to the call and if there was a bank error	1
but would not spell the name of their company or give me the name of the actual person I was speaking with. I asked many questions including when the purchases were made on the credit card	1
but written notice sent in pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act	3
but yet there is a payment reported as received on XX/XX/XXXX? I also asked why the account was sold with an amount being owed as {$780.00} but XXXX XXXX is reporting a charged off amount of {$540.00}?	1
but yet they have been paid in full since XXXX/XXXX/2015. They havetold me two to three different dates as to when they processed and mailed therelease of lien	1
but you finally started issuing them. But Capital One 's decision NOT to issue chip cards until next year is	1
but you still ca n't get a live person. Once there was equity in my truck	1
but you want to damage my credit! I have paid {$420.00} for 5 years and I 'm at the very end and this is how you treat your better that good customers!! I asked to speak with a manager/supervisor because in very upset now! I was placed on hold for a while	1
but you will definitely get credit for your {$5000.00} Earnest Money deposit. The {$3000.00} Lender credit will be negotiable depending on the rates. Right now	1
but {$810.00} just for the 5 minutes the Dr. saw me seems a lot. I was denied my right to see my bill and my good name is being besmirch unnecessarily.	1

by attempting to save money every month by lowering my interest rate by a full 7 % I am now spending {$98.00} more each month instead.

I explained to her that I had my phone bill that had over 31 phone calls from Citi during that time. I faxed it over to them and never heard anything from them. I also realized that she did not send me anything in writing or email format. I continue to get 4 to 8 calls a day from Citi starting at XXXX and XXXX in the morning. All of which are recorded on my phone bill. Last week I spoke with the Escalation department and told them not to call me anymore that anything that I will do with Citi has to be in writing	1

How is it legal for a company to keep accruing interest on {$1000.00} loan for many years that the account has been in default?	2

I asked why was this not communicated to me earlier so I could have taken care of this sooner than now. I was told they send me mail. I said to them ever since my account was transferred to Nationstar all communications from us has been electronic why did they not send me such an important document the same way but chose to send it by paper mail. Bottom line is I have gone to XXXX XXXX today to make the payment I just do n't think I should be reported to the Bureaus as late when I made the effort to make a payment. If they had told me the XXXX time when I called that my payment was not going to be accepted that way because of the block on the account I could have taken care of the payment before it became late. I can not even refinance with Nationstar because of the late payment.	1
catch	1
cause economic hardship to consumers	1
cause the limit to go up and then charge over limit fees. There must be a remedy to this before I am forced to obtain a lawyer. This has resulted in MASSIVE interest rates when trying to obtain credit from reputable sources	1
caused the overdraft. Per bank policy	1
causes of action	1
causing a large drop in credit score. Additionally	1
causing me to be a month ahead in my installment payments. When I realized in XXXX that my escrow account was still deficient I called to request a reversal of that application. Over the months of XXXX	1
causing me to be late for their time line. They have also reported to the credit bureaus that I am behind in payments	1
causing me to receive XXXX additional overdraft charges.	1
causing more interest and they added {$3000.00} in attorney 's fees. They added {$4300.00} capitalized to the balance of my loan at that time to correct the escrow account. There was no shortage until they started adding approximately {$160.00} each month as a cushion to my escrow account. That 's over {$1900.00} a year of my money that they are using.	1
causing my bank account to be overdrawn and forcing me to spend money I had set aside for taxes. I called XXXX XXXX/Navient and explained that I could not afford the payments they had set for me. After asking me several private questions	1
causing my checking account to go negative. When I called them to find out what the issue was they just stated that the auto debit system is n't tied to the online system and I should have called and cancelled the auto debit. I asked why they would take money when no payment was due and they stated that they have a poor system in place. Can they debit money from my account if I do n't have a payment due and my loan is n't past due?	1
causing problems with other payments and would not be doing that again. She supposedly made notes to my account stating the arrangements made. Literally XXXX minutes later I received another call from Navient requesting payment. I told the rep I had just made arrangements. There was nothing showing in file. We went through the whole post-date conversation again. I have tried to get assistance on some of the forgiveness programs but since it is private we do n't qualify. We have been paying on this loan since XXXX and have only dropped the balance by {$3000.00}. I would love to find a way to refinance and get away from Navient. I do n't know if they have internal communication errors or if they are just bullies but I am not a satisfied customer. Also	1
causing there to be alot of late charges and increasing the overall cost of the insurance. but that 's a secondary problem. after a loss mitigation loancare/XXXX- was suppose to have offered us a payback agreement arrangement or give us a modified loan which would have put the missed payments onto the end of the loan	1
causing unnecessary financial and emotional stress. We are particularly concerned that the mortgage broker represented that Capital One could provide a loan under {$3000.00} and that a HUD 1 was never provided to us before closing. Until recently	1

etc had to all be rescheduled for later times. Again I want to stress that Envoy had our loan since XXXX of 2014 and had ample time to make sure this happened smoothly as promised. Someone clearly made mistakes and we were left to deal with the stress and expense. Our moving company is called XXXX out of XXXX NC. They had about XXXX of our belongings in their storage warehouse since XXXX XXXX when we moved into an apartment to wait for our house to be built. In early XXXX we locked in the dates that we wanted them to pull our belongings out of their storage and load it onto their trucks for our move. The dates we chose were for them to load our belongings into their truck on the XXXX of XXXX and then on Friday morning the XXXX they would arrive at our apartment at XXXX to load those belongings and then we would drive to the new house ( only XXXX minutes away ) and they would begin to move us in. So on the XXXX our moving company had already filled their truck with our belongings from their storage. When the XXXX came to an end I realized that we had to make this closing happen on the XXXX since our stuff was sitting on their truck so I contacted XXXX XXXX with XXXX. He made a few phone calls that I 'm sure that helped to get us closed on the XXXX. Around XXXX Friday the XXXX we finally got the clear to close so at that point I told XXXX at XXXX that her men and the trucks could finally be on the way to the apartment. XXXX XXXX told us we could close at XXXX. After hours of waiting at the attorneys office we finally closed at XXXX. The movers were on the clock from XXXX since that day was booked as OUR moving day. They bill at {$190.00} an hour for XXXX men. From XXXX they sat at the warehouse waiting for us to give them the go ahead and then from XXXX when they finished loading the apartment until approx XXXX when I arrived at new house they were waiting on us. We had no notice ahead of time that could have prevented us from getting billed	1

State Home Mortgage knew that XXXX additionally liens where on the title ( down payment assistance lien and XXXX lien ) and knew that I had no intention of keeping the property due to prior history of construction and safety issues with the property.

etc. I did n't receive any paperwork from First Associates. Now I received a bill XX/XX/XXXX XXXX so presumably I did n't receive it until XXXX XXXX stating that I am 15 days past due for almost {$1000.00}. I do n't understand how I can be past due when I 've been making payments and no bill was sent to me about this amount in XXXX. I spoke with someone named XXXX who said "" they tried to email me once. '' Apparently my loan has re-amortized and now I owe exorbitant amounts and have late fees even though a bill was never sent to me in time to pay. I believe First Associates has wrongfully failed to provide me with any information about my loan and who the company is and they are now attempting to force me to pay obscene amounts compared to what I was paying	1
etc. I even requested a new password reset ; got nothing. All I need is for the company to prove this debt. I want to pay them back but do not agree with amount on credit report. I sent proof to Transunion of an email receive from the company stating I only owe the principal amount which is {$570.00}. When I took out the loan XXXX XXXX was charging illegal fees for a payday loan. I informed them of this	1
etc. I get a call on the weekend of XX/XX/XXXX saying I still owe {$48.00} and some change. I spoke to XXXX I explained that I was in there office and paid my balance in full. XXXX then says no you still owe one more payment. Not once could any clerk including mgr. admit they made a mistake or prove to me that I still owned one more payment. I asked for a detailed statement so I could do the math and figure out what I did or did not owe. No one including the manager could provided me with a detailed statement show what my beginning balance was minus each payment I made up onto the day of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX that I went in and paid my balance in full. To this day I have no ideal what I really owe Ace Cash all I am suppose to do is believe that the amount they make me pay is correct. I would like this company to prove to me what I borrowed what they charged me in interest minus what I paid and no one there would provide me with any type of a statement they refused saying they do n't do that. How can I as a consumer know what I owe someone without any type of statement. I also spoke to the Manager XXXX XXXX and he also could not provide me any type of proof. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I made another payment of {$45.00} just because they told me I had to they would not provide any proof I owned any more money. We as consumers are suppose to just pay something because they tell us to as far as I knew I paid my balance in full on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. How do I get a statement from this company so I can figure out if they over changed me or I paid what was due. Again they will not provided me with this documentation. Any bank	1

etc. I was travelling to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Had planned to use my points for travel during that period. But they cancelled my card while I was in XXXX and hence could n't use Barclay card during my international travel at all. I am unhappy with the way that they have closed my account. I have never ever been late on making payments and keeping outstanding balance well within my credit limit. I would have appreciated if Barclay 's had at least notified me about what I had been doing that was unsatisfactory	1
etc. I went through XXXX realtors just to make it happen. Then I got this message from the bank : "" There is a sale date on XXXX/XXXX/2015. The inspection is set for XXXX. there is no way to postpone the sale date so we will remove this file due to not having sufficient time to complete the short sale.	1
etc. I wrote to them twice. I did not receive the information I asked for. Instead I only received something that looks like billing codes from the doctor 's office. I then received a notice from Continental Credit Control that they were going to report this debt on my credit report. I think they have a duty to provide me with the requested information before they can take further action.	1

I know they ca n't give details of the debt due to confidentiality. I feel personally attacked and it has got to stop. This is not the first time this has happened from the same number. I usually do n't answer if it is a strange number	1

etc. She had no answers and told me to contact the original Capital One. I contacted Capital One and they had no answers and referred me to call XXXX XXXX as they had the file. XXXX XXXX had no answers either as they turned the file over to attorneys in North Dakota. I believe I disputed charges and the debt owed is late fees and interest fees how can I get information pertaining to this account?	1

etc. SunTrust is taking advantage of consumers.	1
etc. The man at the loan company basically told me that he did not believe me	1
etc. They agreed to show paid in full ( see attaced ). They are still misreporting at all XXXX bureaus despite multiple attempts. This is causing me after 8 years to still cost extra money with interest rates and failure to purchase a home.	1
etc. They have not responded back to me. They have reported this debt to the credit bureaus. Nobody is giving me information yet they are expecting me to pay without being informed or them identifying themselves. For all that I know it can be a scam! I am still a XXXX customer and I still have the same phone number. It is astonishing that enhanced recovery company was able to reach me at the same address yet t mobile was n't even able to reach me or call me to explain the situation. XXXX effort to contact me was none at all. How am I suppose to pay a bill if I do not see the bill?	1
etc. They refuse to send anything via postal mail and lie about it when asked. They have refused to provide any information on the company and have been asked XXXX not to contact me via phone	1
etc. They said they do n't show any record of me. I asked them if I have no membership with them	1
etc. They stated that a federal complaint had been filed against me	1
etc. This erroneous information should have been removed as I requested but within 24 hours they said it was settled and all still on there.	1
etc. This was faxed on XXXX/XXXX/15. I called occasionally in reference to our pre-approval and I finally heard from him on XXXX/XXXX/15 and he said the underwriter had pre-approved us for the amount we were looking for-dated on XXXX/XXXX/15. When asked what we will need to do once we find a house ; an address-sales contract	1
etc. We recently sent a copy of a utility bill ( water bill ) showing that my mother lives at this property. They are refusing to use the document. This has been going on since XX/XX/XXXX	1
etc. We sent letters every other month since the beginning of the loan and only once received a response and the statement we requestedTheir practices and business has kept us in the dark and with no information regarding our loan for the duration of the loan. In letters we sent it stated that all communication was to be writting and they were not to call	1
etc. When I asked how they knew they told me Experian gives them the information during the credit checking process so that they ( XXXX XXXX can call and offer a competitive offer. I find this activity highly unethical by Experian. A credit reporting agency of all people should NOT be sharing private information with a third party.	1
etc. You waste your breath trying to talk to these people because they just want to hound you.	1
etc. all claiming to be "" within policy ''.	1
etc. and was informed by the tax office (XXXX) that they did not report the information.  A third party apparently sold it to the bureau and they are reporting it inaccurately.  I have disputed the entry and supplied supporting documents.  However	1

etc. for a year now. We are now looking for a lawyer to help stop the sale file a restraining order. We have been treated very badly and unprofessionally by XXXX home loans. We had horrible communication with them there 's no reason for us to be denied a loan modification. We were told by a lawyer	1
etc. has had to be gone through. We are from Kansas and it has taken several lengthy stays to get this work done getting it ready to market between the XXXX heirs. Not to mention we are dealing with a death that occurred during blizzard season. Months into process they refused to talk to executor stating she was not person named even though they had been given Small Estate Affidavit filed with the Court. In addition	1
etc. that XXXX XXXX may attempt to pass along to me	1
etc. that very day so they could get paid immediately and the deal is funded. This completes the verification process and assures that XXXX will be paid immediately on their deal regardless if they have misrepresented information or used predatory sales/credit practices. Credit Acceptance 's "" Portfolio Program '' that XXXX participated in allows them to receive an up-front profit and to share in collections. The owner/salesman XXXX XXXX will do everything possible to close the deal to the point of falsifying most everything he can to put you in a car with the highest interest rates he can because of the funding he receives from Credit Acceptance. I have contacted Credit Acceptance on XXXX/XXXX/15	1
etc. the only difference in our names is the middle initial. The verifications ask about property being owned in states that I have never been to but that he has not only resided in but has been locked up in and is a convicted felon in with a lengthy criminal record to prove it. The questions also mention the names of several woman that he has been married to. He is currently in an XXXX State Penitentiary and public records can confirm that. Other questions did mention city 's that I have lived in and addresses that I 've lived at and belong to close relatives such as my mother and grandmother which is information that he definitely has as well seeing as how my grandmother has lived at the same address since my parents were kids in high school and my father lived with them once upon a time. How do I fix this? I am XXXX years old with a fianc* and XXXX young girls that I want nothing but the best for	1
etc. the result is the same. They also overcharge every single year for escrow account.	1
etc. they will only refer me to a website to complete a form that I then have to get notarized and send to them. Absolutely ridiculous. It is clear that these are not my accounts and the burden of proof ( and hopefully law ) should require XXXX to rectify this immediately. There must be some regulation around tagging fraudulent information to an individual. It 's clear there are some unscrupulous practices occurring at XXXX. How they tied my name/address to this person 's deliquent accounts should be investigated. Also their practice to require the consumer to complete a fraud report and get it notarized is an inconvienence that I as the victimized consumer should not have to endure. This issue is impacting my ability to secure a loan for a significant financial transaction which will cause me a financial hardship if not completed. This has placed a blemish on my credit history despite the fact that it will eventually be removed. I will seek damages if this inaccurate information causes me to lose this financial opportunity for which the loan is for. Someone needs to investigate to determine if this is a widespread practice at XXXX.	1
etc. to XXXX XXXX ( CEO ) via mail and e-mail to ask for assistance in getting this resolved so that I can purchase a home. No response from him either. After finally talking with the resolution department	1

I contacted the new servicing company and they did not have my loan details yet.

After XXXX hours on the phone with Equifax they would not budge. They told me I am not entitled to see report unless I can produce a document that does not exist and never needed to exist under the laws of Pennsylvania.  Thankfully I have not had this experience with XXXX and XXXX."	1
etc.. However	1
etc.. Since then I have received a whole packet of the same information that I have received in the past. I am requesting more in debt information that includes from whom	1
etc.. begin a XXXX	1
etc.i come home with half my gross pay. XXXX per week net!! .I need a mortgage payment closer to 33 % or {$1000.00} per month including principle	1
evaluated and provided me with a denial of my request based on my income	1
even after I have reported a similar incident. This morning	1
even after I provided proof of payment. I have been receiving harassing phone calls many times a day for the past XXXX weeks	1
even after I requested to speak with a supervisor.	1
even after I was assured that my loans should still be deferred while I am in school. When I called the XXXX representative to ask why my application was denied	1
even after adverse action less than 30 days prior. This is all in direct violation of many FCRA	1
even after advising them NO MORE CALLS	1
even after asking me to sign	1
even after being told I would be fine going ahead with my refi	1
even after both incidents my account STILL HAD NOT BEEN FROZEN for my security/protection.. until I called back XXXX Morning ( even after calling regarding information theft on XX/XX/XXXX and imposter on Friday XX/XX/XXXX ). The freeze did not take place until XX/XX/XXXX. On Friday XX/XX/XXXX I called to see the status of my claim and status of the credit to my account - to my utter shock I was told my claim was DENIED	1
even after multiple requests	1
even after numerous conversations with thm that the property was foreclosed in XXXX. According to Idaho law they had 90 days to do a deficiency judgement against me	1
even after warranty on phone had long ago expired.They then billed me for violating a contract at a supposed pro rated amount of XXXX. Next month and when called the # on back of bill ; new charges showed up on bill	1
even as XXXX keeps running up more charges against our credit card accounts without our authorization. Now XXXX is sending us forged and altered documents in order to try to bill us even more.	1
even at night. I want this to STOP!	1
even before I left Georgia. She threatened that the judge would determine what I would have to pay and said that the balance was now {$2100.00} including court and legal fees. When I closed the old account is was due to a {$400.00} unpaid balance ... .certainly not over {$2000.00} I am appalled that someone would use these tactics to scare people into paying them.	1
even if it is their billing mistake. I was floored	1
even if it means going after people like me	1
even if the account holder initially refused the service. Regions and the branch manager refused to remove the {$36.00} overdraft fee.	1
even if the member abided by the terms of the agreement.	1
even if they contact their "" payment processing '' department they can not do it. I struggle with this considering the size of the organization	1
even laughing in my face when I dared ask why she was still my rider.When they finally changed my rider they raised my rates.when I bought a newer vehicle they raised my rates.they raised my premium to {$350.00} a month	1
even more so when it does not belong to them. The account number is XXXX. Please help me fix this. I have attached a police report	2
even my church. It seems that they have a copy of my phone bill and called every one that I may have had contact with. I do not know what to do as I took out the insurance policy with each of them and they should honor it as I paid for it.	1
even so our mortgage payment was increased to the level as if we did n't pap the shortage. When I called to find out why it was increased - I was told I needed to call again after the payment was made to request a new escrow analysis. Why? you did XXXX told me I was short and I paid it. I want the overpayment refunded to me and the monthly amount corrected.	1
even the next day	1
even their notice makes no sense. They returned a check for an amount less than the balance they provided in that same notice. The bank has since refunded the {$35.00}	1
even though Experian removed XXXX.	1
even though I 've been making payments for th past 14 months to FAMS of {$250.00} per month. I recorded the phone call of the agent stating that they could n't help me. I have no idea why FAMS could n't help me because they have been taking my payments for the past 14 months. I called to offer the settlement	1
even though I KNOW differently. The initial phone rep I spoke to lied to me saying it was "" illegal '' for Carmax to adjust the late pay on his credit	1
even though I always pay my mortgage on time ... .. sometimesI XXXX this how much Bank ofof America has been XXXX. I do not take this lightly this has beenthe worst ordeal I have ever been thru in my entire life ... HELP	1
even though I am 3 payments behind already and my account has been involuntarily closed.	1
even though I am over XXXX years old. They have now begun to call my current work place	1
even though I believe this customer was using this stolen- or not stolen- card to defraud/steal from me )	1
even though I contacted them through email to notify them of my travels.	1
even though I could possibly open a normal account online that does not incur monthly fees.	1
even though I did not request the items be paid	1
even though I explained that my husband had suffered a XXXX XXXX and is now a XXXX XXXX veteran and we are trying to recover financially. They call my home and XXXX of our cells repeatedly.	1
even though I had been repeatedly promised no further charges would post I was then told that was false and fraudulent charges which had previously been removed could repost at anytime. Additionally on XXXX XXXX I was promised that a replacement card would be sent out immediately for delivery no later than XXXX XXXX. When I did not receive it I had to waste still more time on the phone before being told it had not been sent for over 24 hours after I was told it would be and would n't be delivered until XXXX XXXX at the earliest.	1
even though I had notified them on XXXX/XXXX/15 that I wanted to cash out and have the funds sent by ACH transfer to my local bank	1
even though I have been calling and they know of the disupute and discrepency on their end. Also my actual payment has been auto deducted each month on time	1
even though I have called to tell them that I have faxed it to them	1
even though I have more than enough in deposits to cover the overdraft	1
even though I have n't been late in yrs.	1
even though I keep trying to get their assistance.	1
even though I knew my payments were paid it made wonder what wasup with this. I know that when a loan is transferred it is supposed to betransferred as it was with the previous lender. However	1
even though I mailed my payment on XX/XX/XXXX	1
even though I never had return payments with them. The customer service rep claimed my bank rejected the payment which was not true at all. I was able to go online with my bank and see the money was already deducted from my checking account already. The credit department even claimed back in XXXX because I made XXXX payments in 1 month	1
even though I supply the documentation that I am attaching today to this complaint. This official complaint	1
even though I was denied on my first try. I have no idea who to contact on this matter.	1
even though I was receiving in the mail	1
even though I was telling her I an missing the statement credit promised to me for completing a purchase offer. I became frustrated and hung up. Then I sent and email	1
even though I was under a program with the State of XXXX/HUD for 'Keep My XXXX Home ' and HUD was making my payments	1
even though Nationstar has been accepting our full monthly payment every month.	1
even though XXXX indicated that they were ONLY moving the payment to the end of the loan. They said they were required to revert my loan back to 30 years AGAIN	1
even though XXXX was the insurer for the party responsible for the accident as determined in arbitration. Westlake has continued to attempt to decrease their liability by claiming that we still owe them when they	1
even though all information that they report is inconsistent.	1
even though at the same time my bank in XXXX not only offered an unsecured loan of {$10000.00}	1
even though at times that made my minimum around {$1300.00} per month. That was not a concern for me as I preferred having all that additional money applied to the principal. And	1
even though back in the XXXX of XXXX	1
even though he is making payments on them.	1
even though it had not posted until the following day	1
even though it is past the statute of limitations	1
even though it over-drafted my account. Then	1
even though it says I paid it in XX/XX/XXXX. I was told the adverse action would be removed from my credit report if I paid it in full. It was never taken off my credit report and now the company is saying I 'm lying about it. I am extremely upset this fraudulent charge can even happen without proper steps being taken. A company can just say that I owe them money and send me to collections without having to go to court and prove it.	1
even though it was forgiven ). However	1
even though it will take XXXX weeks for seller to receive one in the mail. I have a buyer whose loan lock is expiring. 3 ) Since the XXXX was done in XXXX	1
even though my address was up to date I received no statements alerting me that my account was past due ( I have not received any statements from Capital One ). On XX/XX/XXXX over a week later I received a call from Capital One collections. The caller ID was only a XXXX number with no reference to my financial institution. I answered the phone but heard no response on the other end. I thought it was a solicitation call. Apparently it was Capital One collections. They did not attempt to call right back or to leave a message. I was contacted at least two additional times by Capital One collections	1
even though my payments are always made within the grace period. Last month one rep called me and began asking probing questions as to whether I was living in my house or renting it. Itold them that was an irrelevant question	1
even though my statements for a year showed it to no longer exist. I asked to receive a payoff balance in the mail that showed and subtracted all the interest accrual that had not been provided to me in statements for the year	1
even though other banks do it. The manager on duty told me that as a businessman I should have kept better track of my account. She pointed to my phone and told me that I had the mobile app and should have kept better track. She was rude and if I had not been leaving the bank I definitely would after that.	1
even though that is what is written on the statement. He says those are attorney fees for the attorney in some quiet title law suit. I have never received a letter from an attorney	1
even though the account was closed and charged off in XXXX of 2011. Your firm has violated ( including but not limited to ) the Consumer Credit Protection Act	1
even though the banks are at fault. I need help to get ( i ) to recover all my money and ( XXXX ) to find the reasons who is at fault and ( XXXX ) that others do not have to go through this kind of problems.	1
even though the calls were from the same company	1
even though the card 's balance only increased by XXXX to XXXX. I spoke online with an account specialist named "" XXXX '' who could not determine exactly where the numbers were coming from	1
even though the company has our mail forwarding	1
even though the offer page clearly showed my name.	1
even though the original bill was not in his name. They Kept repeating how legal action was about to be taken	1
even though the other XXXX units do not have flood coverage either. A neighbor recently refinanced	1
even though the patient has insurance. I got tired of letters and phone calls from the collection agency so I contacted the XXXX and made them aware. The final result was the collection agency not contacting me anymore. This issue has knocked off XXXX points from my credit score and the note says	1
even though their language caused the mistake. I called Equifax on the same day	1
even though there have been substantially more.	1
even though there was an appraised value	1
even though they are from the same company	1
even though they are not available for my loan type. I 'm now at a point where just over half of my monthly take-home pay is going to student loans	1
even though they did not have anything with my signature on it as such. I paid this in full and was told it would be totally removed off all my credit reports.	1
even though they had access to it	1
even though they had received a written cease and desist letter from me in XXXX 2015 and another one in XXXX 2015. Both of which were logged in the CFPB complaint system and were in writing. In addition	1
even though they had them the whole time. I was sent information that said you would receive payments in XXXX as the house was completed. Three weeks ago I spoke to XXXX as they had received the inspection report indicating the house was at least XXXX percent complete and requested the XXXX draw. I was informed that the XXXX draw was less then the normal thirds they would have send and that the XXXX draw would be larger to get us to the 66 % mark. I receive the draw and it was not the XXXX I was expecting	1
even though they have no proof of my receiving any such correspondence. This is an outrage!!	1
even though they own the loan and there is no third party investor.	1
even though they were advised not to. American Express was made aware of their actions at that time but still uses them. It would appear to me that AE is aware of the problem and approves of their tactics.	1
even though they were advised not to. XXXX XXXX was made aware of their actions at that time but still uses them. It would appear to me that XXXX is aware of the problem and approves of their tactics.	1
even though they write lots of letters telling us what they did	1
even though this first appraisal was done at approx. XXXX on XXXX XXXX	1
even though this is our primary and only residence and is never left untended for more than a few days or week during family vacations. I personally confronted XXXX of the appraisers when they were leaving the notification and asked how they could claim the home as abandoned while we were even in the home and he stated that he was instructed to do as such. These notices are with my personal attorney. Also Nationstar has terminated my auto payment at least once	1
even though this was probably their error or mishap of information ( stolen check or identity ). I am kindly requesting CFPB to please ask TD Bank to please probe my account and see who used it and why I owe them {$450.00}.	1
even though we are at full appraised value	1
even though we had perfect credit	1
even though you have enough money in the account to cover all the transaction but the last one	1
even to have the phone hung up XXXX of the times I called. Finally	1
even when I was paying the monthly due amounts on the XXXX of every month.	1
even when i made a good will effort to pay a debt that had already been paid off.	1
even when just to use the automated system to verify I have kept proper track of the balance. When I discovered XXXX cents had been deducted from my balance	1
even when you have a valid dispute with them. In our case we were disputing an unauthorized charge that the executive office said was nit our responsibility as well as a cyber fraud running balance that began with {$260.00} in XX/XX/XXXX and ended with {$1700.00} -- none of these charges were ever listed as line item charges	1
even with XXXX screwups	1
even with making 50 % of original payments. XXXX company is Regional Finance of XXXX	1
even with the correct address the information fails to reach me. This is a shady company that is not verifying why they are taking what money for. In the last CFPB complaint I filed they did post a payment and charge statement ; however this never disclosed the balance	1
evenings and weekends. This is the national collections departments. I also receive daily calls from the local collections department on my cell phone.	1
ever	2
ever since then it has been nothing than a nightmare ; if it was n't for the persistence of the negotiator from the title company	1
ever. Negotation is out of the question. Their truly despicable customer service is part of this complaint but is the most insignificant. They present themselves as being federal but are neither federal nor private	1
every 3-4 months I have to redispute with a diff company to have removed. this is dropping my score and interring with my life.	1
every XXXX years XXXX has been submitting "" write off '' in an attempt to keep the debt active. MY reading of the data on the internet says that this is illegal. I have lost many jobs and Experian	1
every day	1
every day. I have repeatedly asked them stop calling me at work because I am not allowed to receive phone calls of this nature at work. They have not complied and continue to call. When they call	1
every day. The debtor is my spouse XXXX XXXX.	1
every month since XXXX XXXX. Its a recording of the same information	1
every month since then	1
every month so far they are putting it to principle and ignoring now that the check itself states {$320.00} deferred interest ( XXXX 2015 ) from the bank. I do n't know what else to do to get them to apply the funds to my deferred interest as I was informed I can pay that at any time by simply doing what I am writing on the check how much was to apply for the deferred interest but they are not doing so. Can you help me get this applied to my deferred interest? I am trying to get it paid for its over {$21000.00} and I would like to pay it down or off before the mortgage is paid off. Furthermore	1
every month to furhter inflate the total balance. Their customer service does not help	1
every month up until this year	1
every month. I attached a copy of the confirmation email i received. I also attached copies of how my mortgage is showing in their system ... that is is set up for direct debit.	1
every representative refused any payments because my account was flagged for foreclosure as of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX citing my loan was 104 days past due. However	1
every single day. Many promises were made by the school	1
every time I call the Mortgage Lender ( NationStar LLC )	1
every time I call them I am on hold for close to 1 hour before having to hang up	1
every time.	1
every two weeks I get an invitation to open a line of credit with this erroneous business.	1
every year that I registered the car for my tag XXXX where I live	1
everyday	1
everyone should have received some type of help? Why would a company purchase a mortgage that was already in default? How can citimortgage have gotten away with doing what they do. I know they have alot of lawsuits against them but i dont have the funds to take them to court and now we are facing eviction from a home that we have lived in for 21 years. I feel we were wronged by citimortgage and if they would have remodified our mortgage	1
everything I have seen shows if the home value does not exceed 78 % of initial loan amount then PMI is not required. I have also read that upon request of termination of PMI PennyMac could request an appraisal on our property. We would be happy to pay for an appraisal and feel our property far exceeds the loan to value ratio. Our loan amount was for {$160000.00} and similar homes in our neighborhood are selling for well over $ XXXX. Any information or effort you can make in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated! We look forward to hearing from you!	1
everything but a sales promotion	1
everything fell apart	1
everything inoperable	1
everything was done VIA mail.They had put we went bankrupt XXXX we did not.XXXX XXXX is co- borrower on Home.They would not acknowledge this.Are credit report shows no payments every made on are home we have made every payment until they had told us to stop XXXX/XXXX/XXXX? also took equity out of home to make up for 3 months we missed	1
everything was gone. Before this time I had seen notes next to the files they where being reviewed. At this point I sent emails to them to find out what was up	1
everything was good. I have been calling Seterus for the past 3 months trying to resolve this and see if they will do a modification. Each time I call	1
everything was reviewed	1
everything we want or need is built on Credit in this wonderful US of A. We live in a small house and was saving up to make a bigger home for my kids and CHASE just took everything away because someone is sitting there hitting buttons without anything else better to do. ITS NOT FAIR!!!!!! Obama had them add all those disclosures to the cards to help people learn about credit card debt and help them get out of debt. I could have filed bankruptcy a long time ago	1
everytime I try to call the number it does not go through to the woman. The person that called me today had no record or records of this or the womans name. When I asked to speak to a supervisor I was placed on hold for over half an hour with no check in or ability to speak to anyone before I disconnected.	1
examination of package by payee is done the same day or the next day. Thus	3
exceeding fees by {$350.00} and that they were again "" working on it ''. The loan finally closed on XXXX/XXXX/16	1
except US Bank. US Bank claims that I can not cancel my agreement with XXXX XXXX and that I am required to pay US Bank the same amount {$190.00} that was negotiated by XXXX XXXX. In order to keep my home and not default on the mortgage	1
except a 0.25 % decrease by signing up for auto-pay. I asked if I could be transferred to another department ( collections ) and they stated that they can not transfer me and I ca n't even speak with collections "" until my account is delinquent ''. I even tried to extend the length of my payment period	1
except as the Fair Credit Reporting Act allows. I also ask that you notify NCC BUSINESS SERVICES and tell them the debt is the result of identity theft. I have enclosed a copy of the Federal Trade Commission 's police report Notice to Furnishers of Information. It explains your responsibilities under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). The FCRA requires that debt collectors give an identity theft victim documents related to an account if the victim asks. Please send me copies of all records relating to the account	1

except for Citi apparently.	1
except for Equifax.	1
except for TD Bank because have n't gotten around to review or finalize anything even though they have been recieving information for the past two months. I am now in the situation where I will have no where to live by week 's end and have to pay fees and penalties to various companies that I had set up based around the closing date I was provided. There is no resolution or estimated time on when I will be able close on this house and was given poor customer service by those involved at TD Bank.	1
except for XXXX. They have only included instances where I was 30 days late. Every other month ( but for XXXX ) shows "" NR. '' This is clearly not correct. If an 81 month payment history is included in a credit report	1
except forbearance ( and even that comes with an upfront payment that I can not currently afford. ) I feel trapped and can not even refinance or consolidate because of my poor credit score. Other debtors online seem to have varying success rates getting altered rates or payment terms	1
except from XXXX. I understand these are in my bankruptcy	1
except send us foreclosure notices and threatening letters. Oh but they continue to send us the mortgage modification packs. What do they want from us	1
except they never notified me until after my XXXX/XXXX/16 payment was due. I have direct payments set-up and noticed my mortgage payment was n't taken out of my account on XXXX/XXXX/16. I looked on United Wholesale Mortgage 's website and found in the document center that I had XXXX page letter dated XXXX/XXXX/16 informing me of the transfer. I never received email correspondence of this or physical mail correspondence ( I did finally receive the note on XXXX/XXXX/16 notifying me of the sale ).	1
except they represented a client ... a bank that is not in Texas. The phone number is XXXX XXXX XXXX.	1
except to offer to continuously extend the life of the loan so they reap more money on interest. My credit has been negatively affected because I could only pay {$100.00} towards my {$400.00} loan payment when just out of XXXX and making $ XXXX hour in XXXX . They would n't accept the {$100.00} and preferred to send me to the creditors.	1

explained to the rep my medical insurance. She asked for my Medicare # and stated that she would bill Medicare. I demanded that she immediately remove this erroneous item from my XXXX report	1
explaining my grievances ; OWB avoided the issues and only addressed the issue of MY INCOMPLETE HAMP applications	1
explaining my problem and asking for a reduction of my monthly mortgage payment of {$830.00}. They sent me their response with a loan modification that costs more than what I was paying per month of {$840.00}. Obviously they are not interested in working with me to keep my home	1

I have repeatedly attempted to talk with anyone in this organization regarding an explaination of the random bills being sent to me as well as threats to foreclose on my mortgage while the entire time I am making my payments by the end of the month and have every month and this company is cashing my checks. Just last week I received a bill claiming I owe them XXXX and three days later a reminder that I owe them XXXX. Nevertheless	1

The manager at Select Portfolio Servicing stated that they have an underwriting department that my paperwork will go to when all documents are received and if I have to appeal the decision after the review the appeal will go to the same underwriting department for review again. I was under the impression that if it is an appeal then a XXXX party underwriter has to process the review. So my question is can the same underwriting department with in the servicing company look at a possible modification of the loan after denying it once already?	1
fax or other faster forms of communication. It took XXXX weeks for them to send us the forms required to initiate their process. They say it will take another 5-7 days after receiving for them to process the forms and release the funds to pay for repairs - and that is best case. In the meantime	1

for over 15 years	1
for payment. She is the only XXXX working in her household as my Father was laid off and has been for quite some time. She and I together offered {$75.00} per month as a payment we could afford because we all live paycheck to paycheck. This good faith payment was not good enough for Wells Fargo and they are refusing to go lower than {$310.00} per month. I tried everything I could- offering that I could make the larger payments once my car was paid off	1
for phone calls to stop since it is before XXXX	1
for pursuing foreclosure while I was under review for a modification. It seems that Caliber wants to foreclose on my house and keep me in the dark to prevent me from taking action against them until it is too late. I would like to modify my mortgage or work out a repayment plan or figure out a way to stay in my house. Unless someone else gets involved I am concerned that they will continue to confuse the situation until they can take my house. I want to stay in my home. I am confident that I can make the payments if we can modify my loan.	1
for reference. I transferred the full loan repayment amount to the account indicated in the payoff letter ( a XXXX XXXX account ) before the payment deadline. Merrill Lynch/XXXX XXXX held those funds for 13 days and then reversed the transfer	1

from a New York call center. She informed me that she could not help me and there was not a department that she could transfer me to that could assist me as well. She informed me that she was a manager and there was not someone over her that I would be able to speak with. She told me that none of her managers spoke with clients. This ordeal is causing me a great deal of stress as I have recently lost my job and can not afford fees that I did not inquire. The supervisor insisted on telling me what she was seeing although I informed her that the information in the system is incorrect. Online banking is the only tool BoA clients have to keep up with their funds and with your supervisors telling us that the system is constantly incorrect and that we should not be using it as a way to keep track of our funds is unacceptable.

gave us ridiculous/unreasonable deadlines. Our file was closed without giving us a reasonable amount of time to submit a counter offer to their preposterous offer. They did not use the docs that we submitted ( compiled at their request ). Instead of using all documents to negotiate fairly they chose to ignore the facts that damages to this home are so severe that their offer for a short sale is unfair & based solely on the values of the neighborhood the home is located in & the market conditions in that area. It minimizes the dollar value of the vast damages to the home & totally ignores the fact that the lack of care/action by XXXX are directly related to the value of those damages. Our offer was submitted at {$150000.00} as the home was abandoned/empty since XXXX & suffered significant damage from lack of maintenance/care. XXXX did zero to protect the property from XXXX to XXXX. They since attempted to winterized the bathrooms ( most of the pipes in the house are ruptured ) & bleached the walls/ceilings in the garage to remove black mold. There are no properties in the XXXX area that have suffered the amount of damages due to neglect/abandonment that can be seen at XXXX XXXX XXXX For XXXX to use neighborhood comps to show the value of a severely distressed home w little comparative value to the homes in the surrounding neighborhood is useless. The criteria is incomparable & the values pointless as there are no abandoned/distressed properties in the area. I suggest broadening the comp to nearby towns would result in a more accurate value. The lack of any action by XXXX has severely damaged my personal credit report. XXXX billed me for fees after an agreement was finalized. As of today the home remains in my name 26 months after the agreement was signed. By refusing to negotiate in good faith they are not admitting any fault/culpability for the damages caused by their lack of action in protecting the home for the last 26 months. The home remains uninsured/unprotected as it is empty. XXXX let things fall through the cracks. I was ordered from the home in XXXX Court w a take it or leave it agreement. That was supposed to be the end of the dealings w this property. XXXX did nothing w the home for 17 months until I complained about being billed late/other charges totaling {$19000.00}. We received bills for real estate/sewer taxes from XXXX to XXXX. Once I was forced from the home XXXX did zero to protect the home from damages due to lack of heat/electric/maintenance. The property sat untouched from XXXX to XXXX when we saw that the damages to the home were financially large. XXXX never bought insurance for an unoccupied home & purchased insurance for an owner occupied home despite forcing us out. XXXX never winterized the home. The damages claimed to XXXX insurance companies that XXXX forced us to file claims XXXX were denied as the home was unoccupied. For XXXX to claim {$40000.00} will cover the repair costs directly caused by their neglect is so ingenuous that it reeks of complete disregard to the role XXXX played in causing these damages not to mention any sense of fairness in the negotiation process. XXXX are directly responsible for {$200000.00} in damages to the property & damages to my credit report caused by not acting on an agreement they forced upon us & then abandoned. For these reasons there is culpability for the cost of damages which is significant	1

I have worked in the mortgage dept before and I know if a customer says do n't included over time into a mod due to it may not be offered to exclude it. Citi stated that they need to have a letter sent to them stating about overtime or my mod will be turned down. I told Citi that I have been trying to work with them for sometime now and cant seem to get any results. I told Citi that they can see in my check statements that my over time is n't much at all. I told Citi that my home is underwater and I want to keep my house and to work with me. I let them know that I went through a divorce and took a pay cut with my company but I am working full time and my parents are helping me with my bills and they live with me full time. I let Citi know that I have always sent in all the documents that are requested and cant seem to get anywhere with them. On this pass Tuesday XXXX/XXXX/2015 I told them that over time is not being offered anymore at my company. Citi sent me an email letting me know that my mod would be turned down. I told them that you have never requested this from me before and why is it being requested now. I told Citi that I was being treated unfair and I feel like they do n't want to work with me at all. And I have been trying to have this taken care of for along time now. I told Citi that I am doing everything I can to keep my home for my family and want to work with them. I feel like they are n't helping me out at all and they are treating me unfair and to please assist. I told Citi that I was going to be contacting your office. I just want to keep my home and do a mod with Citi mortgage. Thank you XXXX XXXX XXXX	1

I did and then I find out 8 days after I submitted the second package that the investors of our loan do not do modifications. Now they knew this from the begining but failed to tell us and had us do a whole other package only to reject it once again. Did they try to see if we qualified for other modifications? No they said they only did the "" In house modification '' I asked about a pre payment plan they said I had to come up with XXXX in 3 days or I could not do it.I asked them why the deed of trust that came to our home was in my mother in laws name when we clearly had the deed recorded in our name. they said it didnt matter. I think it does I have yet to see the deed that we recorded to have the house put in our name in XXXX of XXXX. Now dont get me wrong but isnt it illegal to sell a piece of property under the wrong name? My mother in law has been dead since XX/XX/XXXX.I called and asked Ocwen if they had the "" note '' associated with the deed of trust and they said they did I still have yet to see either the deed in the correct name or a promissary note.

he advised that previous payments can not be changed and that I must send in paper checks or pay on their website ( allowing ACH ). Asked to escalate to management and was disconnected. Called back and spoke with multiple people : senior representative	1
he again levied on XXXX pension in XX/XX/XXXX	1
he agrees with me that that would have been the correct way of handling the return of ins. he was suppose to make them do that and get back to me. i have called and left a number of messages and he has not called me back.	1
he alluded to the fact when I requested a lease extension. I had to move	1
he also advised me to contact there research department which is who we sent all our faxes and e-mails to from XX/XX/XXXX. I am currently in the 3rd extension on my home and the home we are purchasing. We are currently paying an extra {$250.00} to lock in our buyers rate since his rate lock has expired. In addition	1
he also should be responsible to pay for fees and stop payments that has resulted from this error.	1
he applied on line he e-signed everything and USAA never verified. Everytime I call USAA my account is locked for investigation "" we can not open your account '' all the agents tell me I will get called 24-48 hours from today. This has been going on for two weeks now. I will never trust military banking for anything especially this one. It is used by many military and overseas as well and I am left to just wait ....	1
he appraised my house at exactly what I paid XXXX years ago. Now I have put on a new roof gutted the bathroom new water heater and put all new bamboo flooring on the first floor. Plus all the houses have gone up in value and I seem to be the only one to stay the same. Then on Friday XXXX XXXX a message at XXXX from a blocked number and it was someone from B ofA stating he only received appraisal a half hour ago and that we need to redo the refinancing ( I feel as if they knew what they were doing and that they had this appraisal done knowing that without value put into my house that I could n't get my pmi taking off ) and off course there is no one that will talk to you call you back or even get a human. Left XXXX a message that I was calling it quits I have been never been treated so poorly and that they have acted like they are doing me a huge favor by letting me refinance. I asked him to justify the appraisal as the houses that he used were XXXX from 2014	1
he argued that i did not. I told him that we always cash checks here & have for 25+ years. I ask him a question	1
he asked for all paper work check credit and all procedures then he emailed me an approval ... he told me to shop for house with confident..few weeks later found house	1
he asked me for the card number itself. For each of the questions he asked for	1
he assumed that they would still send us the payoff we requested. So he called them after our conversation to clarify that they need to send XXXX XXXX XXXX company the payoff as well and that he was closing on XXXX/XXXX/2015. We need your help. We were hung up on twice by XXXX XXXX and was lied to that the borrower did not call them to authorize us getting the payoff	1
he called me at work and left a voicemail stating that I have 5 days to call him or that legal action would be taken. To date	2
he called me irreasonble because I could n't pay the amount that he is requiring	1
he called the fraud department at Wells Fargo and a hold was placed the scammer 's account on that date. The police told me that this type of scam was well known to them and that account will be closed after the funds are deposited. The hold on that account was in place until today XX/XX/XXXX	1
he called with the closing date and then said the next order of business was to discuss what our interest rate would be. When we questioned him on the fact that we had agreed to the loan with the fixed rate at 3.75 %	1
he checked and assured me that my Account had NOT been reported to any of the Credit Reporting Bureaus ( That is the XXXX Party to which I refer. ). I did n't argue the penalties	1
he confirmed that the account was forwarded to the credit bureau on XX/XX/XXXX	1
he continued saying "" Do you have a letter to the effect that the promo ends in XXXX? '' This is gross misrepresentation	1
he corporate phone number or any other identifying information. I called another location of Loan til Payday and got the corporate phone number from them. I spoke to XXXX and explained what happened and he said he would get to the bottom of it and get back to me. I am very angry with her unprofessionalism.	1
he could give me a $ XXXX loan at 1.49 %. I was thrilled	1
he could n't make up his mind. Then he called and terrorized my ex-husband who agreed to pay {$250.00} and committed me to another {$250.00} the following week.	2
he could not tell me my address	1
he did n't acknowledge that he was a debt collector. He did not leave the name of the company he supposedly represents. The company name is XXXX XXXX XXXX Services. I 've already asked them to stop calling my number. They still keep calling. The last time they threatened to show up	1
he did n't have an answer	1
he did n't remember who he had a loan with. The caller ( XXXX XXXX	1
he did not try to listen or get an understanding about what was going on	1
he did reside at my home	1
he disappeared with no further contact being possible. I then obtained an extension from AAG and explained that extreme weather conditions were preventing contractors from scheduling my repairs until after XXXX XXXX. An extension was granted until XXXX XXXX ; as I feared	1
he does n't know what to tell me. I stated "" I have XXXX kids at home and no groceries now	1
he even made sure to mentioned to say that i was n't allowed in the XXXX XXXX location where i ran into XXXX at the front door but I did not bother her. Let me point this out i had no idea anything was wrong until i called to see how much money was in my account	1
he finally agreed I was correct. He was very hard to deal with and we got no where regarding the XXXX payment due. I told him many times it was incorrect. After XXXX hr of this difficult conversation and with no resolution	1
he fraudulently went	1
he gave me his direct contact number. Last XXXX	1
he got his private insurance re- instated	1
he had my social security number. He also said that he would be contacting my places of work	1
he had to check the tapes of the conversation. I would be refunded my {$9.00} but he was unaware of when that would happen. It may take time for them to return my money that I did not agree to have them withdraw.	1
he has a and continues to have terrible credit history. Thank you for you time in reading my complaint. XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
he has to be. On XX/XX/XXXX I had a detailed half an hour conversation with XXXX at the law office and I stated that it is my right to receive a complete breakdown of my payments and charges. I requested this again on XX/XX/XXXX ( when I made my payment ) and I still have not received what I have asked for. Each month	1
he hung up. I continue to receive phone calls from XXXX	2
he ignored XXXX arbitrations attempts. XXXX XXXX I found out they had garnished my pay check at XXXX but also my Utah XXXX tax return was taken. In XXXX the tax return was a {$3200.00} ( a write off because of the XXXX loss )	1
he ignored both arbitrations attempts. XX/XX/XXXX I found out they had garnished my pay check at XXXX but also my Utah state tax return was taken. XX/XX/XXXX the tax return was a {$3200.00} ( a write off because of the oil loss )	1
he immediately hung up on me. I called back and he said he was giving me a verbal warning that i was harassing him and he would sue me. Then he hung up on me again.	1
he immediately received a offer in the amount of {$450000.00} for the property which is more than fair considering the property is under water. Recently PNC informed XXXX XXXX that they were not going to accept the dshort sale because we had not provided XXXX documents	1
he informed me that I misunderstood what he said ( this was the XXXX thing I questioned and got that response ) I stated that I no longer wanted to proceed because I was disappointed with the way they conduct business and could no longer trusted them. XXXX still continued to push as to why I will not let them same me money and at no time offered to send the GFE although it has now been 4 business days since the original conversation. He even stated that all he did was take my info which I disagree with because for our conversation I believe an application was taken because be ran our credit reports and spoke to my spouse to confirm application information. Further no disclosures were sent to me my way of mail or e-mail. For comparison my discussion with my Lender XXXX and QL 's have been the same and I have received countless e-mails and mailings with disclosures from XXXX and none from QL 's. XXXX further comparison	1
he informed me that Vanderbilt received the same notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX office	1
he is also a XXXX. He tried the bank app to take a picture of the check for deposit	1
he is also the same guy the does be XXXX XXXX in a company called XXXX and XXXX and XXXX XXXX. This guy changed his name to XXXX XXXX in the XXXX. They are pretending to be the veterans administration!	1
he is in XXXX. I have all letters that they sent me as well as the attorney. I have a copyright for the name in XXXX.	1
he is only listed on the mortgage since we reside in Florida. I tried to explain this to them and they refused to stop the withdrawal. I do n't think this is acceptable.	1
he is trying to tell me that not only is my rate not locked in ( and it would have been more than .5 % lower than what is available today ) but that he has had to add on extra fees. It has taken so long that I have had to make a mortgage payment in between	1
he just asked for my information and nothing was ever done still. XXXX his colleagues by the name of "" XXXX '' contacted me last week Thursday assuring me that my funds would be made available that day and still my money is not available	1
he just took down the plate number and sent a summons.	1
he later stated that BB & T drop the ball and the closing is delayed without an expected date.	1
he left an XXXX XXXX that required me to be on antibotics	1
he lives in XXXX XXXX I dispute the check with the Capital One Bank immediately but not case number was given to me and I asked for it	1
he lost his card and his account is currently blocked to prevent possible fraud.	1
he made us aware that it would take a full 45 days to close a loan. He stressed the importance of this timeline and we made sure to include him in our decision for our closing date. We were told that our date would n't be a problem. After getting the go ahead from the originator	1
he never answers the phone and he never returns our call. ) Another said the system had timed out and I needed to start the process over. And a third suggested that maybe it was because my daughter did n't have a credit history. ( I tried to apply before she turned XXXX	1
he never picked up and he did n't return my voicemail messages. The BBB case was closed	1
he noted that his branch had an overlay issue due to a recent purchase of another home. We had informed him of this prior to him pulling credit. This issue is a standard XXXX issue and for Wells Fargo is usually an automatic turn down as they typically sell their loans immediately. We had already contacted another lender who did not have the same concerns regarding the overlay. They could have done our loan. The problem here is that the Wells Fargo Lender realized that he would not be able to do the loan on this particular house if the builder allowed us to purchase it	1
he offered to have me make a payment up front of {$150.00}	1
he refinanced the home through USAA in his name as primary borrower but also signed my name through the power of attorney as secondary borrower. My signature was listed and signed by him as power of attorney. USAA knew the deed was in my husband 's name alone as it was an exhibit to the refinance mortgage	1
he refused and got angry. Told me i had to pay at a XXXX XXXX store which i found odd. I asked why i have never received anything prior to this in almost 6 years and he said they sent me 2 letters but no one was there to receive it. Wouldnt they leave a note saying a certified letter was trying to be delivered? I have never received anything. I spoke with them on XX/XX/XXXX	1
he refused to issue refund and offered a XXXX dollar gift card in exchange	1
he refused to leave sitting in his car and I called the police to ask him to leave.The following day	1
he refused to make needed repairs and rigged everything. Code compliance was called by us and many other residents and they would still not fix things. It took them XXXX months to repair their a/c system even after being fined. We were forced to move because they moved in a XXXX next door to us and we had a family. Even after numerous complaints and police visits they still refused to evict them because they paid cash for their rent. Crime there was another huge issue. I could go on and on with all the reasons why we had to leave but the point is they are wrongfully trying to collect a debt that is n't owed.	1
he refused. I asked him to explain the situation to his supervisor and see if she could waive the fee. He came back and said his supervisor XXXX XXXX denied the request	1
he relented and granted an exception.	1
he reported it at $ XXXX as memory serves. I was a single father at the time	1
he said "" Sorry we do n't do that. '' Is that customer service? No	1
he said '' I will tell my boss and I will call you ''. I have n't heard back from them. It 's very clear Experian is using discriminatory practices when it comes to my name and insist on keeping me at the lowest rung of the economic ladder. I want it stopped and I want to be compensated for the continued discriminatory practices being used a against me. Any consideration given this email would be greatly appreciated.	1
he said I need to call back to their "" loss mitigation department '' I know NationStar received federal $ $ for assisting with the housing crisis. I completely understand why a class action lawsuit was filed against them.	1
he said about XXXX was for back rent XXXX for broken widows. There was no broken windows. I believe XXXX for screens and another XXXX for carpet cleaning and XXXX for labor but he could n't tell me what was fixed. I started to dispute charges and he said it better I do n't fight it. The best thing for me to do is is accept it and make an offer to them for XXXX dollars. I told him I thought this is a scam I never heard of this debt it 's been XXXX months the last time I spoke to anyone from the property management company all they said is that they needed the other set of keys. He said ok. I hung up and thought nothing else of it until I was checking my credit report and saw that XXXX was sent to XXXX credit reporting agencies. Like I said I never received a letter a phone call nothing. I do n't know how long the home was empty after I moved out. We had a brake in while I lived there and put in a alarm system. Someone could have broken in after I left. That does n't mean I 'm responsible for the damages and it 's unfair to try to make me pay for it. There were a few things wrong with the house so a representative form the property management company came by a few times and noted how well we kept up the house. Me and my roommate are both XXXX we were hardly even at home. If there was that much damage why not contact me right away so we could deal with it then not three months later. Because there was no damages that 's why.	1
he said because the account was no longer in there system they could n't do anything. He gave us a number to the company it was sold to in XXXX ( XXXX ) but it is no longer for a collection company. So my husband called Portfolio Recovery back today ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) and spoke to a XXXX at ext XXXX and asked her about the alleged account and she stated that they brought the account in XXXX and tried to reach me to collect on the alleged debt. My husband asked her how could they try to collect on an alleged debt that was XXXX years old at the time they brought the account in XXXX since the account was closed by XXXX in XXXX	1
he said he can not change it. It was the fault of the agent for not clarifying with me the transaction.	1
he said he needed it for payment.	1
he said he would be back later that evening	1
he said if I want to get help I 'd have to get back in line. XXXX came and was very courties to me and understanding	1
he said no that is not acceptable. I explained that right now I do n't have any expendable income and he said "" Well we are all living paycheck to paycheck ''. He kept using my name in a derogatory manner. I just did not like how he was speaking to me. So I hung up the phone on him. Then I decided to call back to get the name of the company and when I called back he kept using my name to let me know that he knew who I was. I told him that I was happy that he had caller ID and I hung up.	1
he said there would be legal fees added in. I did n't think they should be because his letter said that it would n't be sent for foreclosure until a decision was made. He said I could send in an appeal letter disputing the legal fees being added to a repayment plan so I sent an appeal letter on XXXX/XXXX/15. I called on XXXX/XXXX/15 & XXXX/XXXX/15 and was advised it was still pending a decision in the escalation dept. We received a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/15 on XXXX/XXXX/15 from the escalation dept advising that our request for a modification would remain denied. I called on XXXX/XXXX/15 and stated that we were appealing the legal fees ; the customer service rep said he recognized that and was sending it back to the escalation dept for review. I called on XXXX/XXXX/15 checking status and to try to make a payment ; I was advised that it was still pending and that we were not "" allowed '' to make a payment. I also confirmed again that foreclosure proceedings were on hold. We received a letter on XXXX/XXXX/15 from the attorney 's office advising that there is now a sheriff 's sale date for our property. I called Shellpoint on XXXX/XXXX/15 and he said the decision was still pending. He also said that the "" sheriff 's sale was n't until XXXX/XXXX/15 so we should have a response from the escalation dept by then. '' I asked why there was n't a hold on it and he could n't say. I called the attorney 's office right after and she said there was no hold on our file.	1
he sends me short	1
he sent me another e-mail indicating my closing costs would go from {$750.00} to {$15000.00} ( but he encouraged me to just do it ). I was angry. He said he would re-imburse me for the appraisal over the phone. And then he stopped returning my phone calls. This is predatory fish and bait lending. He lied a number of times. It has been quite a blow to my family.	1
he should have said something. My recent conversations with customer service confirmed to me that this old card had never been activated and no charges had been put on it. Regardless of how I 've tried to explain the issue I received no help. They continue to refuse to honor the offer and reward me with the {$150.00} gift card.	1
he started yelling and said no	1
he stated it was XXXX where he was. When I pointed out he was fishing for information	1
he stated that he got permission from a supervisor to override the {$50.00} forbearance fee and process the forbearance through XXXX/XXXX/15 and if I wanted to request another XXXX	1
he stated that he has no record as to when this account was opened or became delinquent and that they place random dates on credit profiles.	1
he stated that he only knows what the client has stated and that I owe this money. The attorney has threatened my business and to subpoena all my investors and I did not want this embarrassment and agreed to a settlement. I am reconsidering my position and would like verification of this debt.	1
he stated that my history had no one assigned to my account. ( This must be why I have not been able to reach any of these people! )	1
he stated that since my account had not been open six months	1
he stated that the extra was for the shipper	1
he stated they are at least 30 days behind	1
he states he can not refund me the entire amount charged to my credit card	1
he states it is simple theft	1
he strongly insisted to speak with me. I excused myself for a moment to let XXXX XXXX know I was in a meeting with a XXXX ; and he was rude and yelling at me. He tried to speak over me as I was telling him that I was not going to have a conversation with him at that time. He began talking over me again by stating that the call is being recorded. I said	1
he talks very loudly over me and will not listen to a thing I have to say.	1
he then demanded I make XXXX payments on XXXX	1
he told me that apparently a glitch in their system did not put the correct amount into the closing cost sheet. When I revised the file	1
he told me that the account was opened by me XX/XX/XXXX. I then told him that I did n't go by the name he was stating over the phone since XX/XX/XXXX when one year later I went into the XXXX and the military legally changed my name to my maternal mother 's last name. So I told him good luck proving that I existed by that name XX/XX/XXXX	1
he told me that the account was opened by me XX/XX/XXXX. I then told him that I did n't go by the name he was stating over the phone since XX/XX/XXXX when one year later I went into the XXXX and the military legally changed my name to my maternal mother 's last name. So I told him good luck proving that I existed by that name in XX/XX/XXXX	1
he told me that the issue lies within another technician disconnecting my services and using my line to work for another household. He rectified the problem	1
he told me they could not provide service because they could not see their satellite. I understood and contracted with my local cable company to provide service. I received a bill from XXXX shortly after this and I called them to explain the situation and they said they would cancel the bill. I never received a bill XXXX ( the internet provider ) so I assumed that their service was also cancelled. About six months later I got a phone call from a collection agency telling me that I owed XXXX {$440.00} and they were attempting to collect it. I explained to them that I did not owe these charges and that I never received a bill XXXX. I have not to this day ever received a bill from XXXX and that if I had I would have dealt with the issue at the time and it never would have gotten to this stage. The collection agency has placed a collections item on my otherwise impeccable credit report and I would like to have it removed.	1
he took a picture of it and said I had everthing he needed. By this time	1
he took back the written terms and conditions for the credit card. I questioned him if the application was in fact denied	1
he took the credit cards and the rest was history. All accounts at Wells Fargo of 20 plus years were comprised and closed	1
he tried to explain to me what happened	1
he was defrauding me and did not pay the company their portion of the rent	1
he was hostile	1
he was maybe at my house XXXX min .... my Realator said	1
he was not available to speak so I spoke to someone else	1
he was not helpful at all. He refused to credit me back the service fees and tried to put the blame on me instead. I was shocked by the dishonest business practice and the lack of professionalism of the branch manager.	1
he was refuse to answer again but staring at me. When I continuously ask him if I can record his word	1
he was saying this looks fake ( I must say ONLY BECAUSE HE SAID HE NEVER SEEN SUCH A MESSAGE BEFORE )	1
he was told to convert his account to adult. While away in college	1
he was unavailable and so i spoke with another lady. She informed that BofA wanted me to resubmit a form due to it not being signed. When I did speak with XXXX XXXX 30 minutes later	1
he was very hostile and began ranting that his employees would never run a person 's credit without their permission. I gave him the employees name and he told me he would like into the matter. I received a call from XXXX XXXX several moments later profusely apologizing about the situation. I asked her why she pulled my credit without my permission and she indicated she was not aware of Wells Fargo running "" hard pull inquires '' on business savings accounts. She said I would receive a letter stating that it was a mistake and it would be removed from my credit report. Since that date I have received the run around from their credit bureau department as well as XXXX. I want this inquiry removed from my XXXX report. Prior to the incident at hand I never had a conversation with this woman nor did I sign anything giving her permission to pull my credit	1
he will close it. After that date	1
he would not answer. I also have my XX/XX/XXXX monthly statements that show the total reduction yet he would not acknowledge ; he kept repeating the "" XXXX charge '' was per IRS guidelines but would n't discuss why the contract/modification starts in XX/XX/XXXX. In good faith I held up my part of the modification by making every payment on time. Now I have to pay taxes on something I should not have to. My Account # is XXXX. I have not contacted an attorney yet.	1
he would not give me a settlement amount	1
he would not need any personal information	1
he would then pass it along to his Supervisor to review and make a decision regarding reinstating my former credit line.	1

But do n't they have to have some sort of time frame to get things done in? Are there any federal or state guidelines?

XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is a collection agency which performs collections sevices for XXXX in association with a collection claim on a defaulted account.	1
here we go again BOA! After dozens of attempts to find out where my payments were going I found a rep who finally explained to me that once again BOA charged off my loan there would be no further contact from them. I also found out my account was put in their bankruptcy dept. I did not understand this because yes I had to declare bankruptcy XX/XX/XXXX but it did not include the house. BOA however considers the HELOC to be a revolving product thus declaring me bankrupt	1

We sent Ocwen a letter the next day on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating that this modification did n't help them and they would like it to be closed out and reviewed for an in house modification to see if maybe there was a better modification offer for them. Ocwen then said it would take a few days to close it out and it was never closed out until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. It took about a month to close it out after we sent them a letter and they received it saying it would be closed out any day now. We resubmitted updated documents at that time XX/XX/XXXX to be reviewed for an in house modification	1

how can I fix it? When I did go into my account later in the month and saw the late notification I called and paid on the spot.

This has enormous negative ramifications for me/us as we need to refinance the house this year and now do not know if we can and if so it will cost us more and the interest rates will be higher.

I can not begin to tell you how extremely frustrating and aggravating this ordeal has been because i need copies of my checks and payments.	1
however did n't see a process to joining any class action settlements.	1
however fees are still not refunded and bank is not responding to my inquries. I have attached a new signed form XXXX to this claim again.	1

I then asked what bank was the credit card company affiliated with he was unable to provided me with that number. I called again and all of the mention information including the fact that they could not open a fraud case unless the XXXX was received was confirmed by XXXX rep XXXX. I then tried my luck with a supervisor and was told that they would only disclose information to a police officer.	1
however he never received any letter either and that we had to pay overXXXX to stop the forecloser process. And that they have until XXXX XXXX to supply me with the information that we requested. We feel that this is an attempt for Caliber Home Loans and XXXX to defraud XXXX CITIZENS. And to date they have not sent the information	1
however it 's been almost a month since my card was stolen and the charges are still on there. If I was a personal card holder	1
however it is not considered late until the XXXX of the next month. This is harassment.	1
however it is still showing up on all credit bureau as a DEBT and as a DUPLICATE. The collection agency is giving me the run around and it has affected me tremendously	1
however it still remained listed as 0 %. I then pulled my money out of it on XXXX/XXXX/2015. When I went to close my XXXX Prepaid yesterday	1
however my payment was a higher amount. I contacted them on XXXX XXXXXX/XX/2014 and was told that they would not be able to credit that amount since it was received by XXXX. They proceeded to tell me my mortgage payment would be increased to {$1100.00} per month and would not be the {$1100.00}. The amount of {$57.00} was listed on my XXXX XXXX statement for the month of XXXX from Seterus as a single payment to my escrow account. Yet	1

however no matter how many documents I send to them they respond by saying they always need more documents	1
however no one by that name lived here. They said they would stop calling. I ca n't believe debt collectors are allowed to contact people with the same last name on a constant basis and not even know they live there or not. Could you please assist me with stopping these phone calls.	1
however once I called back the story changed I began getting the run around and was advised to email it because they can not receive fax. I emailed the information needed and they still refuse to report my credit.	1
however over the past year and eight months since I began the process I have fallen further and further behind on mortgage.	1
however refused to expedite the process of correction	1
however she says we did n't do it properly so we owe. I have told her I am having an attorney review the file. She called today XXXX times and is being incredibly rude to my staff	1
however since it was their mix-up	1
however stated since I opened my account before the change	1
however that is the address used to obtain the report this morning.	1
however the 20 % part of the loan was not. The XXXX part of the loan was sold to a debt collector which is known as Real Time Resolution. The debt collector	1
however the XXXX XXXX was not. Upon my investigation	1
however the approve left off the XXXX lean to the state of michigan. I submitted request XXXX lean required information and Ocwen keeps telling me that it is not acceptable. I ask them over and over what they want me to send and when I send it they continue to ask for the same document over and over that I keep submitting. I have been working on this file since XXXX 2015 and it has been a difficult task every step of the way with Ocwen.	1
however the check was never deposited. XXXX XXXX XXXX called to inquire and then sent another check for {$91000.00} on XXXX XXXX	1

however they are simply refusing to discuss the terms with me.	1
however they refused to do so. They said my only option is to return the part of the order I did get and get a refund for the entire order	1
however they refused to remove the false information. XXXX is attempting to prolong its time on my credit by reporting on a closed account knowing that it can stay on my credit for seven years after the last activity. I am working with a home loan program that looks only at the last two years of credit and therefore this account would not be a factor in determining my eligibility for a home with them if they are not allowed to falsely report activity. I am asking that the account be removed from credit in all XXXX bureaus because the company has proven to be irresponsible in reporting information. I have proof via prior credit reports that this account was closed and charged off XX/XX/XXXX. upload screen shots of said proof	1
however they took 16 days to process my request for cancellation and proceeded to charge me for those 16 days. Had they processed my cancellation promptly their systems would not have thought I had a pending bill. They then proceeded to put me into collection for {$110.00} that I did not rightfully owe them. I proceeded to pay it to avoid any impact to my credit and I intended to take the issue up with XXXX directly as opposed to the collections agency. The collections account has hit my credit 2 months in a row now	1
however today I received notice from them that they were going to just "" not report '' ( but already showing late ) for the time period of XXXX to XXXX and just report going forward. So was reported incorrectly while they did their clean up and now they are not going to fix it.	1
however we did n't close because the house contract expired due to Regions Bank appraisal delay.	1
however when I was advised that I was going to have payments increase over time and also a balloon payment of o $ XXXX	1
however when I was just about to call Amex to see if there is any other option they closed my account and voided all my XXXX rewards points ( worth {$320.00} at least ) ; there is also ongoing unresolved transaction dispute on my account while it 's cancelled. I was never notified by email or call	1
however. my prefix and number are known to be a cell phone and an entry was required on the application in this line. I guess if you do not have a landline Synchrony Bank does not issue credit. My big issue with Synchrony Bank if that they did not transmit caller ID and should they make another Robocall it is illegal and without permission and can result in significant liability for Synchrony Bank.

i believe charging XXXX Dollars for covering XXXX Dollars for less than XXXX hours is pure usery and a violation of their fiduciary responsibility. Why this fee structure is not scaled is beyond me.

i called another firm and he told me that he could get my FHA at 4.25 % about a {$50.00} a month in payment based on my principle. His lending fees were also over XXXX the new guy was XXXX. I feel that if i wasnt willing to take a risk to try the new lender ( i was already under contract ) i would have been stuck paying a much higher rate than i am now. I know it is illegal for mortgage lenders to make money off the spread but why was their rate over .5 % more? Someone padding pockets at UMC? Please use UMC in XXXX XXXX XXXX if you never want to be able to reach your loan originator	1
i called the Best buy customer service and complain that my payments were not making a difference and these high interest rates are the cause. The customer service representative was very nice on the phone and suggested a solution by putting me on a "" Promotion Allocation plan '' she said i can keep the same amount of monthly payment of {$73.00} which she said is definitely above the {$25.00} minimum payment and this should be sufficient enough to bring my total balance down as long as i keep these steady payments recurring monthly at {$73.00} per month. That was all the information that was relayed to me by this customer service representative nothing else was included or said to me by this person. Every month i sent in the steady payment of {$73.00} and did noticed i was finally seeing my balance decreasing from {$970.00}. Until XX/XX/XXXX	1

i do not understand how it is that u get a prepaid card so i can not spend what i do not have avaliable to me. i have spoken to them and i was told that it was a glitz on there end	1
i dont just have that kind of money to throw away or wait for. When i got this prepaid card i didnt think their was ever going to be such a hassel. Boy was i wrong. Makes we want to stick to the local banks where i can actually go in and see and talk to someone when issues arise.	1
i emailed XXXX XXXX again and he told me that i needde to pay {$42.00} transfer fee to transfer money	1
i ended up signing a new loan agreement in the amount of {$8900.00} which is higher than the orignal one ( {$8500.00} ) even after paying {$2400.00} all this money that i paid has gone out the window	1
i explained him my situation he was not able to find that account with my personal info he had to search by the apartment complex and he located an account that was under someone else name. that person had my same last name so he told me to send them my personal identifications and a copy of my dispute XXXX that it seemed that my social security was attached to the wrong person. So i send those documents and i also disputed the account XXXX again. The re-investigation was finished on XX/XX/XXXX 2015 and once again XXXX is not removing this account from my credit report and ProCollect is not willing to help me on this matter every time i call they are unprofessional and they are not able to locate an account under my social security or legal name but they are putting something on my credit report that they dont have record of.	1
i feel that my mortgage banker is giving me the run around and wants the fixed rate to expire next week so that i am forced to pay a penalty and forced to take on a different and higher mortgage rate. what should i do at this time? can you please help me.	1
i finally spoke with a lady on XXXX who got my funds released on XXXX this was the worst experience ever with this company	1
i first notified Ditech of XXXX and XXXX missing payments. despite repeated communiques	1

i got put on hold without knowing and how they lying on social sites this is all on top of whats going on with my account..I should have receive my paycheck direct deposit on XXXX/XXXX/15 to this date no check and today is XXXX/XXXX/15 no agent has called me or anything. Most of the rep just do n't say anything I 'm tired of this this is so stressful	1
i had paid the debt and it is closed but they will not stop reporting and the least they can do is update the open date and stop parking an old debt.	1
i had to give them my identifying information. They hung up on me in the middle of my own sentence about why they would n't be getting my information over the phone. they called me back about an hour later and it was another delayed call without a person on the other end. If i legitimately owe a debt	1
i have a VA loan and want to avoid foreclosure completely	1
i have a co-signer. I explained that my co-signer helps with other aspects of my like financially to ensure i can stay current on my student loans. All i asked for was work with my on some type of repayment package	1
i have a new bank and have no issues. even the BOA branch had no idea why BOA corporate "" ended my relationship '' with the bank after 10 faithful years and abiding by call contracts. i had used this card faithfully for several years and paid the card in full faithfully	1

i have attached a copy of the resolution letter	1
i have been in my home for 18 years	1
i have been stuck four months now with ins and car pmts on a car i didnt even possess	1
i have recorded conversation with an agent as a proof..XXXX has overly charged me {$66.00} after the account is closed and without reaching out to me they have sent my account to collection. I could have just paid off enen though it was wrongfully charged..I spoke to XXXX as well as many debt collecting companies for removing these charges but instead these companies keep selling my accounts to new comanpnies and my credits score has gone down from XXXX to XXXX. This is the only debt collection i have in my credit history and this is not fair to consumer ... It 's hurting my credit really bad.	1
i have tax record on the property that shows the right zip code i gave her and i have a payment receipt from last month.	1
i have the necessary income to live very comfortable financially. In XXXX	1
i have yet to receive the check. I 've been on hold for XXXX minutes so far	1

I told him that i hope this is being recorded bc he is out of control also mentioning that I 'm protected from when i filled for bankruptcy a few years ago that i paid XXXX for this house owe XXXX now and that I have read the contract that i signed under the modification prior to my bankruptcy with them. He keeps on with his tone and anger disrespecting me demanding. That i must pay. I then identify my self as a XXXX and that i do not like his tone. He goes on demanding the payment before XXXX 2015 he adds by saying "" pay out or leave your paying rent ''. I said wow i cant believe i hope this is all recorded and before i loose my cool i decided to hang up.	1
i just want my account closed and i only owe XXXX to the checking if that XXXX on my credit card minus the charges.lawyer was XXXX XXXX FILE # XXXX. to show that i followed thru and they have not and its fraud	1
i know what ocwen says	1
i legally have to pay the debt for it to go away	1
i made agreements and paid these off. I have worked hard to build my credit back up and my daughter is building hers	3
i made payments XXXX XXXX XXXX 2013 then i found out that XXXX sent a credit of {$70000.00} to the IRS who is demanding me to pay taxes on that amount. they denied my remodification application twice	1
i met a mortgage broker and she advised me to contact CFPB. i really hope there is something that can be done	1
i no longer would receive statement from them regarding my Mortgage Payments. from my understanding My wife bankruptcy has been Discharged. I have never filed Bankruptcy. I was told by Citi	1
i only make {$690.00} every two weeks.	1
i reached out to them and did n't get any help. see attached document	1
i received a letter from XXXX stating that they bought my account and that i owed {$390.00}. I immediately disputed this claim	1
i received a letter from midland credit management stating that they bought my account and that i owed {$390.00}. I immediately disputed this claim	1
i received email notification that my "" Ally bank account is open ''. I then began transferring money and depositing checks into the Ally bank account. As soon as I deposited my last check	1
i requested a package never got XXXX	1
i responded to letter and preceded to send in a third letter and they respond was that the information im disputed information is not on file. I call to see if that would help instead of sending letters. They explain to my that the last letter saying that disputed information is not on file was a mistake. but the intended letter	1
i sent an email to XXXX XXXX as well as ocwen consumer relief to see if maybe we qualify for some of the foregiveness plan through their settlement with XXXX states attorney generals and you guys suing them that was a thursday and on friday at XXXX a lady named XXXX called me from ocwen	1
i sent it back same day with a check of XXXX. This is a case of incompetence or hiring people with no training on how to carefully handle the public 's credit. Their stuff are misleading the public who unknowingly hurt their credit scores. Had the agent let me pay the XXXX dollars	1
i sent my payments on time	1
i sent them a letter specifically requesting proper validation. Buckles failed to provide any kind of legal documentation of any application.	1
i should speak to my lawyer. on every statement i get it tells me i may call and speak to XXXX different people	2
i still have not received ) on this action. XXXX XXXX went on vacation and XXXX XXXX stepped in and also stated the information of the return will be mailed to me. ( still nothing ). on XX/XX/XXXX	1
i talked to supervisors	1
i then asked for an email of proof of debt. He took my email address down and did email me a letter. ( It 's really fake looking. Like a child could type up this letter kinda thing. ) He told me that if i wanted to avoid 90 days in jail that i would take care of it right now while on the phone with him. I told him I had to make some phone calls first before i could pay it in full if it was a real debt i owed. He told me that when i called him back that he would transfer me to the right person so that i could make payment. I then asked for that persons direct number and he refused to give that to me as well. I called my local sheriff 's department and they assured me that I would not be arrested for this and that this was just another scam and not to pay. I also called the original debtor and spoke with their collection department. I do have a debt with them and they transferred it to United Debt Holdings in 2013. She also went on to say that what XXXX XXXX was doing was illegal and that it was a scam and not to pay them a dime. She gave me the number to United Debt Holdings and told me i would get a voicemail and to leave a message. I did so after getting off the phone with her. They have still not called back. This XXXX XXXX was yelling at me and telling me that he 's just a messenger and not a debt collector but yet he 's asking me to pay money so now i 'm confused. He was very rude and refused to give me any information that a normal debt collector would have. I have witnesses to this phone call as well. I put it on speaker phone for my neighbor to hear just in case this was real.	1
i thought it would be the cheapest giving it had XXXX miles and 12 years old.	1
i told them I do n't a monthly payment of 700.00. they said i would have to fight the payment of XXXX until i file homestead exemption and i will drop about 300.00 a year and the would put me closer to my request. I said ok	1
i told them am ready to provide any other form of identification but they refused unless they call me on cell phone	1
i told them i was on the "" do not call list	1
i trust them	1
i understand that Equifax is a giant corp. that makes a profit off reporting credit info on consumers but this is so unfair to me for them to not do whats right and remove the information.	1
i want transunion to delete this negative information from my credit file immediately to enable me pursue my financial goals	1
i was also told that years ago my previuos mortgage company did an inspection and thats what that charge is for. I even spoke to a supervisor who told me that there was an error in the billing	1
i was immediately asked to provide debit/credit card information to make payments on the amount owed. After I declined to provided said information	1
i was informed i was unable to because they could not use my sons XXXX XXXX check that was apart of my income. The company had my file for 4 months and waited to tell me this at the very end after XXXX missed closing dates. I gave my 30 day notice were i was living	1
i was later told the only way it will no longer be noted as CO was if i paid the balance in full of XXXX. I 've contacted the credit bureau	1
i was left with XXXX income	1
i was misinformed	1
i was planning to live for XXXX illinois and i told her. in between my departure and the time i was given a notice i get a hole on my tires twice	1
i work hard to provide for my children and will do the same in making sure i can keep my home for us.	1
i would be turned over to collections	1
i would need to wait 45 days for an investigation before my funds are returned. I asked to have my funds that were remaining on the cards but not in dispute returned to me immediately ( approximately XXXX ) while waiting for the disputed charge ( approximately XXXX ) to clear. This set off a maze of phone calls and conflicting information from representatives about the current status of my dispute and how long it would take for me to receive access to my funds. At this point it is unclear whether USBank is even appropriately attempting to remedy this situation.	1
i wound up with XXXX different stories and non made sense. They are refusing to issue os a check for {$260.00}. They said that that amount was included in our escrow check	1
i wrote letters to the leasing office and spoke w/ them personally. they said i could leave and no monies would be owed then a collection company reported a {$6000.00} balance on my credit. this is not a true collection! i left for safety issues owing brookstone {$0.00}.

identified herself as "" XXXX '' and wanted to discuss a recent complaint that I filed with the CFPB. I said "" Fine ''. She then said that she wanted to record the conversation and I agreed	1

identifying themselves and who they are calling for. This information is never provided. I answered XXXX of these calls from yet another unknown number ( this time at least a company name showed up on caller ID : XXXX XXXX ). The caller let me know this number was listed as an alternate number for my brother. Ok. That 's fine. I can take/deliver a message. Then the caller continued to say that they have been trying to reach him for a long time. I told the caller this is the XXXX message I have received. If a message is not left	1

if I did not want to be responsible for the condo fees	1
if I do n't check behind them this will continue. Ocwen raised my monthly amount before the five years was up to XXXX whereas the agreement with HAMP was XXXX monthly for five years. When you call to talk to them they say their going to investigate the situation but nothing is done	1
if I do n't have time to mail my payment I have to pay it over the phone which costs {$15.00}. I believe that having the system always unavailable forces mortgage customers to pay the {$15.00} fee. Also	1
if I do not make a payment then I will be held responsible for the entire amount of the loan. The vehicle is totaled. It just has n't been officially totaled by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX due to restrictions of XXXX State Police because of the nature of the accident.	1

if I was already having trouble paying how would making me pay all this extra money help? My lawyer I was seeing told me I either had to agree to pay them the $ XXXX/month or if I could not come up with that I would have to file bankruptcy. I spent awhile mulling over if bankruptcy was the right choice for me because I was unsure how I would come up with that much money. I became so stressed out over this as I could not believe a XXXX year old had to consider bankruptcy because he chose to go to college. I kept just thinking how did my life come to this? I eventually decided I would not file bankruptcy because I did not know how that would affect the rest of my life going forward and I chose to live with my parents and basically have my entire paycheck go to this payment. This made things really hard for me because I did not have money for anything else and the stress and anxiety continued to pile up. I tried many times to work with the collection agency to see if they could lower the payments or work out an alternative payment plan but they would not budge. I am now XXXX and I am still forced to live with my parents and unable to move forward with my life. How can no rehabilitation program be offered? I can not move forward with my life in this situation.	1
if a few documents are required or within a few days of XXXX-XXXX pages are requested. It seems after each submission latter part of XXXX we would receive email/mail stating : 'your file is now complete and has been forwarded to the underwriter ' Then some time later we get the request for more documents	1

if it is my money and I can see that enough is there to clear any debits or checks they can not do things behind the scenes in order to make more money. I am in the process of changing banks and I want the FTC to look into USAA and their practices as I am not the only service member who has experienced this. I want those fee 's refunded as there was money in my account and I also want their "" system '' to reflect actual dates and times of transactions accurately. Again I have proof of all that I have alleged and would be more than happy to hand it over to anyone who wishes to see it. I want to ensure this stops happening to those of us that serve. Thank you	1

She had to let everyone go and was closing the store. Her attorney called while I was present and she was clearly distraught. I asked her to look for my file and she could not find it. XXXX days later I called Chase Visa 's fraud department and asked the balance I was unable to use ( {$660.00} ) be removed since I was unable to collect the services. Chase VIsa sent a postcard months after I filed a claim ( attached. ) Chase Visa did not respond to my request until the following XXXX of XXXX.

They never told me that just because they showed money in my account and it has cleared that they do n't actually have the money. XXXX very deceptive ).

in fact I just received my XX/XX/XXXX statement 1 week ago. I paid the balance off but I refused to pay the {$21.00} late fee. They stated they can only give XXXX-XXXX per 12 months	1
in fact I more then qualified. I was just because they stopped the application process before even being considered. Also the supervisor I spoke to said I should not have been told that a "" senior loan rep '' would be calling me. Apparently that is not what I should have been told. So I feel like not only was I giving the wrong information by the initial phone rep	1
in fact been deducted from my checking account. I contacted them several times and each time they swore everything was fine. Finally I made a manual payment from my checking account and held my breath	1
in fact the hiring company said a few times that no personal info was required untill I passed the 4 weeks of training and met the hiring manager for the final interview. So for the XXXX project I was issued XXXX that had an account # and routing # XXXX CHASE BANK XXXX with funds that were put into my name that were to be used to purchase the equipment. I was asked to use my personal CC at this time till I became full time employed. I transfered the funds from the account info provided into my personal CC and waited till the funds posted. Once posted a few days later I proceeded to purchase the requested equipment and ship out of country to the designated address. I was requested to use USPS priority international delivery.

it 's just a quiet. The person they are looking for is not at this number and NEVER has been. We 've had this number for over 20 years. I 'm crazy with their nagging! There 's been more calls than above noted. Please get them to STOP!	1
it 's like they are wanting you to get behind or something. 60 days would cause it to show late on my credit report and I 've NEVER been late with my mortgage before and do n't plan on it either!!!	1
it 's my dad 's	1
it 's not included and I wo n't agree to have it included now. That seemed to be the end of it until I went to get my payoff and the "" Deferral of Principal '' was listed and included in the payoff balance. I have sent correspondence to Ditech who now services my account but with no results. I 'm hoping that this complaint made through your office will help me get a correct new payoff	1
it Ocwen 's policy that they do no take out payroll deductions from anyones income that will be helping to support the original lein holder	1
it appears the following happened : I made XXXX purchases on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and made a payment the same day ( described above ). However	1
it appears they have changed the property address per letter dated XXXX XXXX	1
it became abundantly clear they had willfully and intentionally lied to me about it. I can only assume this was in an attempt to cover up their continued and unchecked proliferation of identity theft. A little harsh? Perhaps not as credit card companies are by far the primary reason identity theft has become such a huge problem worldwide that has destroyed XXXX and XXXX and XXXX of lives.	1
it became clear - because Wells mentioned it -- Wells ran a 3rd appraisal they never told us about	1
it ca n't be reversed & they ca n't tell me how long it will remain on my account. I pay a payment 2 or 3 or 4 times monthly so that I keep my balance down and have more credit to use. I want my points.	1
it came to my attention that the principal of the loan was much higher than I expected it to be because I was being charged 5 % interest per year. I had paid almost {$400.00} in interest as of XXXX 2015. I am upset because I was never told in writing or orally that I was paying interest. I was also discouraged to pay a lump sum and was actually told that it would n't be advantageous to me	1
it caused my checking account to have a negative balance. I then received XXXX overdraft fees totaling {$140.00} for purchases that were already pending on my account at the time of the incident	1
it clearly states no assignment was TRANSFERED	1
it clearly states that they would reply in 24 hours. No reply has been received back at this time. I have also written the Ombudsman and have received no reply back. My other complaint is they have change the terms on online payments. It states that you can not make a free online payment after the XXXX. The terms of loan agreement is the payment is not consider late until after the XXXX of the month. I am extremely dissatisfied with the service I received from Owcen and could only imagine how difficult they would be to deal with if I ever ran into financial difficulties	1
it clearly states the following : "" If you notify this office in writing within 30 days after receiving this notice that you dispute the validity of this debt or any portion thereof	1
it contained no other information that I requested. I suspect that this is a scam attempting to collect on a old debt or debt that I know nothing about.	1
it cost me {$580.00} to be a Bank of America customer visiting XXXX XXXX for XXXX days. Of that {$580.00}	1
it could negatively affect the credit of both the ex-owner and my family.	1
it could not go towards the following months minimum. the next due date was XX/XX/XXXX. Payments were applied XX/XX/XXXX	1
it could result in bullying the public or compelling them to open up bank accounts with TD Bank	1
it did not execute the next day. It executed only on XXXX. I wrote to the bank and they responded saying "" Trades get processed in XXXX business days ''. This is contrary to what their website disclosures say. I lost money because the stock price moved.	1
it did not happened immediately. XXXX started to charge me fees!!!!	1
it did not. On XX/XX/XXXX	1
it does not look like anything will happen with my concerns without Bank of America being compelled to act.	1
it does not show that I have a balance due with them. Knowing that the collections was from my car accident which occurred in XXXX	1
it dropped my credit score XXXX points and I need it removed from my credit report. Please help me with this problem. The problem was that he had to use my mailing address because he was an XXXX.	1
it ended at over 84k	1
it failed. I just received repeated calls from a number of only '' XXXX '' the voicemail left was threatening in nature..they said I only had hours to correct the error. They then said that if I did n't fix this	1
it falsely claims that at some point I owed XXXX {$280.00}. I have not and do not owe this money to XXXX. ( Please note that an address in XXXX XXXX appears on Midland 's demand letter	1
it gets better. You see while we were having to switch back to the regular VA loan the interest rate of 3.5 % went back up to 3.75 % so now I officially lost that better interest rate as well. XXXX 's boss calls me and states that I can pay money to decrease the 3.75 % interest rate to 3.5 % interest rate. I 'm confused on how it 's my fault that I lost the 2.8 % and 3.5 % interest rates. I was deceived into thinking I was getting the Texas VA Land Board loan. I have been misled and Wells Fargo has not taken any action to improve my situation. I was originally supposed to close on XXXX/XXXX/15. The Seller has had to sign and addendum. Since they are in the process of purchasing a new home they have had to payout money to keep their interest rate. I have spoken to consumer affairs at Wells Fargo and nobody seems to care that they have ripped me off and put me in a situation that I can not get out of without losing money. Nobody is holding anyone responsible. I still have the same loan officer who ripped me off from the get go. The only acceptation is that I now speak to his boss XXXX and not him. Why is this guy even still working on my loan. The worst part is that even being one week out from closing my loan tracker shows that my XXXX and XXXX who is the loan processor only had 40 % of the loan complete. They assigned a new loan processor to me and I completed more work with XXXX in a week then I did with XXXX and XXXX in XXXX months. We are well over sixty days of closing. My family maybe spending XXXX in a hotel. Nobody is holding Wells Fargo accountable	1
it goes to voicemail and the mailbox is full. Also I was never sent a bill or contacted by anyone that had an outstanding balance before receiving a collections notice.	1
it had a credit of over XXXX the check written to CITI XXXX was used to pay the card I intended to keep open. I have had numerous calls to Citi to get this resolved	1
it had a late fee and all of the accrued interest charged.	1
it had a negative escrow balance of {$1200.00}	1
it had an incorrect NPV gross monthly income amount and incorrectly denied HAMP Tier 2 eligibility. On XX/XX/XXXX	1
it had expired already ). My monthly bill was {$150.00} for cellular service and wireless internet	1
it had my name on it. My address is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. When I opened the letter it was an "" Intent to Foreclose '' from the Law Office of XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
it had the XXXX highest number of complaints. The victim further learned that PNC settled claims with the XXXX	1
it had those closing costs of {$2100.00} ( {$790.00} origination fee + {$1300.00} for XXXX whole point ). I immediately contacted XXXX asking why those fees were there. He assured me that Quicken Loans would credit the entire {$2100.00}	1
it has also caused several inquiries from the same company which is XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have at least XXXX inquiries from this company in about a month in a half period because Equifax was informing me that the issue was resolved and it was not. They also said that they ca n't do anything about the inquiries that was made from this company. I informed Equifax that credit was only pulled because you advised me that the issue was resolved. Furthermore	1
it has been 14 monthsand a total of XXXX spent trying to get my credit report.	1
it has been 3 months and Equifax still responds that the information was verified. How can it be verified if it not mine???	1
it has been 6 months and nothing except phone calls that I am always 1 month late	1
it has been a big headache until today. I loss my XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX I ask them to please help me to get a loan modification but they did n't help me	1
it has been a nightmare. I get charged {$63.00} for a PMI "" insurance '' that I have requested to drop and no one can assist me on this. Why in the world do I make monthly payments to this company and can not get helped ever. Just FYI I am still on hold and it has now been XXXX hr and XXXX mins. Still on the phone XXXX hr XXXX minutes and no solution. Please help what can someone do who never choose this company to be their mortgage holder in the XXXX place ...	1
it has been determined ( have a letter from Ocwen in hand ) that the loan was overpaid and Ocwen owes me {$13.00} ... The debt collectors refuse to take me off their call list. They want ME to write a letter asking to be removed even though it their mistake.	1
it has been discovered that they are continuing to report derogatory information to the credit bureaus in the amount estimated around {$4000.00}. We have left multiple voicemails for the company and they are not answering the phone or responding to the voicemail messages. This has destroyed my credit. It is the policy of my apartment establishment that any applicant who was denied based on rental history debts	1
it has been sold numerous times to different companies and is currently with Ditech. Around XX/XX/XXXX	1
it has changed hands due to banks going bankrupt	1
it has increased. According to my most recent statement	1
it has not When I tried to disputed it again	1
it has not only has impacted me emotionally but has damaged my position in the company and the ruined my buyout and reorganization of the company. It has financially impact me substantially and ultimately it could cost me my XXXX and my livelihood.	1
it has now been six months since they gave me the final modification.	1
it has to be paid in full. I told her that that is not fair debt collection practice and that I am only contractually obligated to the {$1800.00} and we can set up an arrangement from that. She asked me in a condensing told "" if I wanted help or not. '' I told her she can not refuse my payments. We went back and forth a few times and she ended up telling me to have a good day and she hung up on me.	2
it in fact did change the pricing which is making it so we would need to charge you	1
it included mortgage insurance. However	1
it increases my debt to ratio in a negative way	1
it is MY responsibility to make sure that I send it in a timeframe which will guarantee it will arrive ON OR BEFORE the date it is due. Why is n't a BANK held to the same standards? Also	1
it is a call centerI am told one person is handling my issues	1
it is a general reply of "" we are waiting on underwriting ''. We are now on month XXXX of the refinance	1
it is a little frustrating for customers and myself	1
it is almost impossible to find a phone number or any other contact information for these people. The only thing listed for dispute resolution is an address which could take you months to resolve anything and by that time they can hit you with all kinds of late fees etc.	1
it is also a holiday evening	1
it is always on the exact same form. This is a company I have never heard of	1
it is exceeding XXXX. I need help addressing this debt and with negotiating fair and just payment options with this loan while I have extremely low income.	1
it is harassing me at my place of work and embarrassing when I have no idea what it 's about. They call from XXXX	1
it is hard to make a good career immediately after graduating	1
it is hurting my household budget. Even though I 've been making the payments	1
it is illegal for XXXX XXXX or any creditor when a debt is old to put it on a credit report as a brand new debt. I have disputed this with both XXXX XXXX and The Credit Bureaus they will not remove this debt. I have XXXX other XXXX and a XXXX with XXXX XXXX that are paid on time every single month. I have been a loyal customer to them for several years and yet I am being denied a Mortgage because XXXX XXXX continually puts this old charged off account on my Credit Report as Brand New making it look as if I just had this XXXX Charged off and refuses to remove it. Please help.	1
it is illegal for a debt collector to share any information regarding a debt with a XXXX party other than the conusmer	1
it is important for my credit rating since I am a small business owner and ca n't afford the hits to my credit.	1
it is just my mortgage payment and household bills.	1
it is legal for them to ignore the Do Not Call Registry. ] We are looking for an answer to this recurring annoyance.	1
it is most likely happening to many others. If Macy 's does this to everyone	1
it is not past due. She would not order a new card. I am not due until the XXXX	1
it is not through Dept. of Ed. and I was only XXXX at the time. Then the letters started being mailed to my home	1
it is often incorrect. What American Education services is doing is committing fraud by knowlingly giving out incorrect information. I recorded multiple calls from their company	1
it is quite disturbing to be told that they discourage this practice and that they are aware of the mishandling of the monies that are paid outside of the customary monthly payment schedule. Obviously	1
it is right there on my credit report. I am concerned that they are ignoring the issue and do not want to update my credit file. I paid over XXXX dollars for them to receive my formal dispute and they have not even addressed the issue. I even stated that it was a public records concern and they did not reposed or investigate it. Their entire reinvestigation seemed to have been done in a few days time	1
it is several times per day. They do not leave a message	1
it is showing on my bank statements. My very last payment to GMAC for XX/XX/XXXX was completed the same way	1
it is simply a nightmare trying to get false information removed from a credit file.	1
it is still on there and still marked as unpaid. This is my second complaint to CFPB	1
it is too late and random of an occurrence for them to justly charge me now. This should have been caught months ago.	1
it is unfair to force us to pay the penalty because of XXXX XXXX mistake. It is also not right that our credit is now showing delinquency because XXXX XXXX did not take care of their responsibility.	1
it is worth noting that my student loans with Wells Fargo have been current and in excellent standing for two ( 2 ) years now. By Wells Fargo refusing to assist me in the deletion of these 30 day late on my credit reports	1
it is worth noting the agent had a bad attitude and was rude. I wound up 3 way calling the bank ( XXXX	1
it just a robot. I have since set up payment	1
it just was n't true. I would send in the info anyway. When I did n't hear back	2
it keeps me extremely buried upside down to the point it feels like a cruel joke. They did a total breach of contract. The changes below highlight the significant changes : SETTLEMENT OFFER XXXX 2014Loan Balance : $ XXXX Value : $ XXXX : $ XXXX & Interest Payment : $ XXXX 2 % for XXXX years.	1
it kind of is a hiring company.	1
it looks like it would be XXXX upon XXXX of dollars more. Maybe I 'm overly sensitive at this time due to the buzz around Quicken 's Rocket Mortgage ad during the XXXX XXXX	1
it may take longer to process. We noticed about XXXX weeks ago online that our house payment had increased by about {$340.00} per month. The escrow amount was about XXXX but the principle and interest had remained the same. When we called recently	1
it mean i want be able to get anything back from 2 of my tires.they refused and want me to pay {$1200.00} which is the whole amount the collection put in my report and one thing i didnt like is they still calling that a settlement.the first payment of {$700.00} suppose to be paid the XX/XX/XXXX.i want a fair resolution of this case	1
it means the bureaus have not received such a request. So	1
it means they called me while I was at work XXXX. She made a settlement offer while we spoke	1
it never arrived. They drug it out past the "" renewal window ''. I had a XXXX call with BOA and XXXX which got very heated. BOA "" bank of America '' said it was Insurance company so we then got her on the phone as well. BOA still insisted and XXXX was amazed by the ignorance of BOA	1
it never really clicked that this could be a scam. I 'm not sure what happened. These XXXX collection agencies were collecting for the same company. I 'm currently getting my credit repaired. Letters of validation were sent out on my behalf to this particular company. I received the original contract and a letter stating that the debt was sold XX/XX/XXXX	1
it only mentions payment received date.He said he would take it under advisement. From talking to the XXXX representatives I do n't think they understood that Caliber Funding LLC. is breaking their own Note terms.	1
it plays a recording and hangs up. Their main office number says	1
it reflects was the same amount	1
it reports that both loans have 25 year terms	1
it said I had been approved for a XXXX dollar PayPal Credit line! I never even knew I was in the application screen for PayPal Credit ( card ). I called immediately to PayPal support who told me that all they can do was close the account	1
it said I still own {$800.00}	1
it says "" each '' which means "" all '' or at a minimum two months in a row. This seemed crazy to me. So I think Chase should be required to say. How to avoid interest? Never carry a balance. If you do carry a balance for even one month	1
it says "" user not found ''. I called up and the client representative also could not locate my account. Can someone responsible from the bank clarify if I have an HSA account with the bank or not?	1
it says nothing reported for employment. I have been employed by systems Contracting since XXXX of this year	1
it says that the office is now closed ( I have tried through out the day	1
it says that they ran my credit in XX/XX/2015 and seen this drop and now two months later are decreasing my limit	1
it seemed	1
it seems as if they are looking for my reasons to change? They have been verbally asked to stop calling so frequently Additionally I submitted a written request to them through their own internal contact process a copy of this message is attached ; however this has not deterred them at all. The company is Exeter Finance Corp.	1
it seems misleading. I pay my only credit card off in full every month	1
it should be noted	1
it should be shown on my credit as a chaarge off - settled for less than due and not a Foreclosure. The way BofA is reporting this on my credit is keeping me from purchasing another home for 3 years. I am requesting B of A report this as a charge off of a credit account and not a foreclosure.	1
it should be updated on all XXXX credit reports ''. Because this was not done	1
it should improve. It has been over six months with no resolution Thanks	3
it should n't state that I was charged off because there was no negative balance at the time of the account closure	1
it showed me nothing! I have attached scanned copies of the attachment that procollect sent me as validation of the debts appearing in my credit file for {$600.00}	1
it showed up as "" unapplied payment '' when I called to ask about it I was told it would switch to "" principle payment '' after the next cycle	1
it shows as new debt. For example	1
it shows me how their standards have declined. Why did n't B of A contact XXXX 3 months ago when this all started.? What exactly is their job? They close my case without doing Their Jobs. This is pathetic!!!!!!!!!!!	1
it shows on my credit bureau as "" Closed Account by Creditor ''. This has adversely affected my credit standing in an immense way. I am asking that SunTrust reopen my credit card.	1
it shows that we have paid that down to {$190000.00} which is over 80 % LTV. So I called Wells Fargo to ask them to remove the PMI charges from my mortgage payment. I was told that I would either have to pay for an appraisal	1
it shows the debt as being disputed. First and foremost	1
it shuts off	1
it sometimes takes longer for USSA to process the funds. Despite a long telephone call	1
it starts all over.. I have to answer several verification questions and then at the end they tell me to go to the branch.. I just feel so hurt sometimes	1
it stated that there were no current late charges and the balance due was {$1400.00} and {$87.00} for the negative escrow balance for forced placed insurance which was under review at that time.	1
it states that Green Tree has not completed an analysis since the service of the account	1
it states that there are allegations regarding possible "" discrimination impacting approximately XXXX XXXX and XXXX borrowers who potentially were charged higher interest rates and fees than XXXX borrowers because of their race or national origin rather than the borrowers ' credit worthiness. '' As part of the XXXX XXXX dollar settlement	1
it takes weeks before Citi acknowledges receipt. By then	1
it was $ XXXX. I re-filed a dispute with transunion on XXXX XXXX	1
it was OK till XXXX	1
it was a MasterCard	1
it was a computer wich was paid for with a personal check with my name printed on it. After 4 days it was returned with receipt. But we did n't get a refund at that time. We were told that we would have to wait another week because it was paid by check allegedely	1
it was a simple needing the buyer to sign a release form to allow the rental agency to send the documents to the lender. After that I do n't know what the reason was for a 2 week delay in closing. It was a lot of simple mistakes and not owning the issue. Luckily we closed ; but	1
it was a window asking me if I wanted to open a PayPal line of credit. I was upset when I realized what had happened	1
it was adjusted in new loan! ( this was onhis cell ) not recorded ). XXXX XXXX card was renewed and told it was inprocessing and then on XXXX XXXX	1
it was agreed to cancel the check. The check was canceled that day	1
it was already in process by the next morning. They eventually explained that Seterus only allows them to send electronic payments	1
it was already returner to sender 2. BOA and or their representatives stated they mailed required foreclosure notification but as you will see from the attached USPS tracking - the letter arrived at the Post Office for pick up on XXXX XXXX	1
it was an act of congress to get the same supervisor on the phone an dwhen I spoke to her she acted as if she had no clue what I was talking about.   XXXX I reminded her of our XXXX hour conversation	1
it was automatically deleted from my inbox	1
it was automatically linked to my preexisting online profile. '' It would have been extremely helpful if CHASE had notified me by e mail that this had been set up. In all of my transactions with credit card companies none have done this all of my accounts are independent and established by me. Upon contacting CHASE 's executive office and requesting to speak with the individual that sent the letter I was told CHASE was recording and I could not. This matter is not yet resolved and my e mail notification with CHASE has not been established.	1
it was brought to my attention I did not have flood insurance on my property which I am required to carry on the property. To make a long story short	1
it was citi mortage account XXXX why is this happening to people? and can we get the money they conviently took from us my husband died XXXX XXXX and the stress of this did n't help I sold my home and moved to XXXX where I have just file a complaint with XXXX	1
it was clean. XXXX XXXX said he works in the sears office of pres. and because the cancellation policy does n't say anything about clean room I will not be issued a credit	1
it was dead air so I hung up. I do n't have time to sit on the phone for 5 minutes waiting for somebody to answer the phone when they are the XXXX who called me XXXX. Either way	1
it was declined causing me to panic. Once again	1
it was deleted and reinserted on XXXX XXXX	1
it was delivered on Thursday	1
it was discharged via mother interest on the title and courts records shows shes not on the mortgage and to this day has XXXX Credit. This stop to auction sale briefly. Now just two weeks ago .another foreclosure went before the court but this time the lender request and era on their part and requested from the court to stop sale and the judge denied request and property was auction off. An appeal was filed to stop transfer of title. Please help I do n't know what else to do other than file a complaint.	1
it was discovered that ASBESTOS contaminated the condominium. With the still frequent rains	1
it was due on the Wed before. The girl I talked to said that it would be ok and she would mark it on my account. The next day my phone was turned off. I called to have it turned back on they said it would cost me XXXX plus the next month 's bill	1
it was electronically taken and I had forgotten that it was to come out on XXXX XXXX	1
it was explained to me about the life insurance purpose	1
it was for a purpose.Today on XXXX/XXXX/15 XXXX contacted me and stated that he was going to transfer me to his Supervisor by the name of XXXX XXXX badge # XXXX and wished me many	1
it was handled professionally.	1
it was him. I did explain personal and business issues since recession	1
it was incorrect. XXXX revisions have been made by Seterus to my mortgage payoff statement to date	1
it was involuntary. In the interim	1
it was lost	1
it was mailed to the wrong address. I was offered a "" lien release '' letter instead. I have had the same address from the signing of the contract in XXXX. The representative could not explain why all of a sudden they had an incorrect address.	1
it was my debt	1
it was my fault. I called them back and asked the rep to use my bank account to pay off my balance. He said he would take care of everything. My balance and any interest charges I owe would be taken care of. This was 3 months ago. I have since received a couple of hundred dollar charges on every statement received after. When I inquire about it	1
it was n't	1
it was never available to me	1
it was never mailed to me	1
it was not an informational letter. It took me 2 separate calls to get someone to send me a letter stating that I	1
it was not fixed. I called Bank of America for a XXXX time and spoke with XXXX and superior of card financial services	1
it was noted that my address was incorrect	1
it was noted that the payment was not being properly applied on the date of payment. The payment is still processed manually with a paper payment sheet	1
it was only his job to deliver the furniture. I sent everything back and began a dispute with m my XXXX. last year on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX charged my credit care again for {$710.00} and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX for XXXX	1
it was probably an error that account was used	1
it was processed in my name only. XXXX XXXX XXXX told her District Manager in XXXX	1
it was rejected.	1
it was repeatedly vandalized and expensive items were taken from the property. These crimes caused me to not be able to complete the renovations and subsequently pay the mortgage. The lender	1
it was reported that I had not made my monthly payment )	1
it was showing as if I was derogatory on making my monthly payment - even though the loan had been paid via the settlement. I called capital one to dispute this	1
it was showing my account is delinquent and there are late fees accrued. I called Wells Fargo customer service in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to notify for this issue and late fees and to this date there has been no correction made to the account.	1
it was signed for as recieved but put on my account as late because it took XXXX days to work thru their system with the incorrect information. This company is terrible. How are they still allowed to get away with the things they have been cicted on. Something on a federal level needs to done. I should not have to fight this battle alone. The only person that agreed to help me straighten out this mess was XXXX XXXXXXXXXXXX. She has alot of my his tory and results of this mess	1
it was still the same and completely out of line with the other competitors costs. I contacted Chase who assured me they would work with management to get this resolved after the fact. I proceeded with closing as we were 30 days past original close date as is and my sellers were now at risk of losing the home they put a purchase offer on. I followed up with Chase on numerous occasions as of close date	1
it was supposed to cover all charges. I was told it did not. I asked for the total amount I paid into the account. I was told I paid a total of XXXX. I stated that if the original amount borrowed was XXXX	1
it was supposed to go towards the loan. Numerous complaints have been filed against dealership	1
it was taken off however but put back on in XX/XX/XXXX. I am asking that this fraud alert be taken off of my credit immediately.	1
it was the old account number so it was returened. However	1
it was understood that the bankruptcy filing would not have an effect on me and would be removed from the loan due to the fact the previous owner who filed for bankruptcy was no longer on the loan nor listed on the deed. My attorney and I ( I have had to hire an attorney to try to resolve this issue ) have been in contact with the mortgage company since XX/XX/XXXX requesting that the bankruptcy status and any affiliation of such be removed as the mortgage company is/was reflecting my mortgage loan account as being in an active bankruptcy status as I have never filed for bankruptcy or ever been affiliated with any actions. The mortgage company has continuously given us the runaround	1
it was up to the case manager to sort them and file them with the different properties. I have submitted a letter of appeal for ( XXXX ) The bank went ahead with the foreclosure claiming I did not file papers in time. Later we found out the papers were filed incorrectly. Another Property ( XXXX ) the bank decided to withdraw their offer in XXXX XXXX for {$11000.00} claiming there is a rule against cash for keys when a house has a Sheriff sale date. Now my new case manager XXXX has informed me the bank will not offer the cash for keys because the house is in active foreclosure. What? Why?? XXXX of the houses were in active foreclosure when they made the offer in XXXX. Suddenly the rules have changed? I was given the offer for the Deed in Lieu with {$11000.00} for ( XXXX ) with the tenants remaining in the house. Late XXXX I was told to have them move out and I should pay off a {$1700.00} lien and then I could reapply. Suddenly the rules changed. To be honest I do n't trust the bank and their offers anymore. I was not going to kick my tenants out before XXXX and if I do have them vacate	1
it was with XXXX XXXX	1
it was with XXXX. Around XX/XX/XXXX I was informed my monthly payment was increasing by {$180.00} due to a shortage of escrow. My mortgage has escrow since my home is worth less than I paid for it. The problem with this increase is my taxes and insurance have only decreased over the years	1
it was written on my statements that my maturity date is XXXX XXXX. My issues are with all the money that was applied to my principal since XXXX and adjustments made to the amount of interest that has been amortized. I also understood that the extra one-month payment a year would also reduce my interest that further reduces the loan payoff date	1
it was {$13.00} this month	1
it went through Paid XXXX XXXX through XXXX ... they never got or lost check. Waited til end of month to see if it would clear ... it did n't	1
it went to the arrears amount which resulted in late fees and penalties.	1
it would 've been too late. This is unacceptable.	1
it would all stay. My frustration is that my wife pays our monthly bills and I knew something was wrong when I got a phone call. If they had used a person instead of a computer to call me for the recent missed payment	1
it would assist them in getting out of this situation. I believe these payroll advance products are predatory due to the facts I 've listed above and are not intended to help the customer	1
it would be incumbent upon XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX Hospital ( XXXX ) to notify us that the insurance would not cover the treatment. Especially before it reach the level of thousands of dollars. No one has been able to explain to us how we arrived at this point.	1
it would be rejected by the bank in a couple weeks. To avoid a late payment	1
it would be too late to fix my XXXX payment and I would just have to pay that amount. I called again today and was told again that nothing was shown as being adjusted on my account	1
it would just fall off in two years. She told me that though I had never been late for any payments	1
it would n't make a difference. I 'm certain that was a lie	1
it would not accept the information via telephone to activate the new card. Upon logging in online	1
it would work for XXXX or XXXX phone calls but then we would go through it all over again. They insisted that the payment I made was XXXX and would go all the way back to the payment they told me to skip saying they were all late. I received multiple harassing phone calls daily. It did n't matter how many times I explained they insisted I missed a payment. They never would assign me to just XXXX person to handle the account	1
items from issues with credit reporting companies. but seems no results also	1
items would bounce because actually there was not immediate access to the money through the on line account.	1
itis attached	1
its going to take effect XX/XX/XXXX because after reviewing your financially documentation I do n't make enough money ''. As I ending up the conversation I advised him I will file a complaint against Wells Fargo for this bait and switch method/tactic with the State and Federal Agencies	1
its individual agents	1
its off by over {$1000.00}.	1
its reasoning - that we did not comply with a fall XXXX requests for documents - is incorrect. We provided responses to their most recent request in a timely fashion on XXXX XXXX	1
its revolving	1
its successors and/or assigns. I spoke to XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX	1
its unfair. I made the agreement in good faith but I never agreed or signed anything stating US BANK could debit my accounts for a total of {$210.00}. I ca n't pay US BANK before I pay my mortgage	1
ive neve used such company i have foughy this debt numerous times. Finally deciding to let it roll of my credit history after 7 years	1

just Equifax. Until the error is fixed	1
just a coincidence that this happened in XX/XX/XXXX. Please help us understand what is happening with our mortgage. Thank you for your help as always.	1
just a few months after obtaining the loan. I fell behind with payments as my resources dwindled	1
just a lower mortgage payment. We have no idea why it would be so hard to give a loan modification. It would seem preferable to a foreclosure or short sale for them	1
just an innocent third party that they are harrassing that I would have to communicate with them via mail. Finally agreed to send me over via phone so solution could be expedited	1
just as I did here and the name of the Clerk of Superior Court in XXXX (original attachments).  Yet	1
just as the letter states. However	1
just continue paying {$150.00} and we will just continue receiving it. We did not reach an agreement to pay specific amount monthly	1
just deposit them.	1
just did n't like being late due to the way my paychecks fell. He proposed that I not pay XXXX to give me time to save up the extra payment then for the next 6 months pay XXXX $ that would end up covering the missed payment in XXXX and my payments would not be due till the XXXX. That sounded great. I said sure. I received an agreement in the mail that said no need to respond to continue on about this payment plan just make the payments as follows. I did and I paid the XXXX $ on time like i was supposed to do. Come XXXX I received a certified letter in attempt to collect a debt from my past due payment for XXXX for Chase. I called and they said yes that is correct	1
just fine. I do not want my payments being made over the phone or via mail so a working website is absolutely critical. I would like to attach a few screenshots of tonight 's payment attempt. Hopefully	1
just goes the rep 's voicemail but they never call me back	1
just harassed me at work.	1
just have me going in circles. Can you Please help me rectify this matter.	1
just have to email and hope. After several emails	1
just in case I broke equipment or things of that nature. They advised I would have a fee of {$10.00} and an initial fee	1
just made sure we repair our credit.	1
just my guess ) because all of a sudden I had this balance in my account. The folks doing this were alleged "" loan officers '' from whatever name they used. I was not happy. Called the bank first to have these transactions reversed immediately. I like to try and pay my bills. I argued at length with the phone reps telling them I was not the one who called in making these claims. I was sure they kept records of there calls	1
just never have a working phone number so no one can call and bother you ... ... ..	1
just not in implementation.	1
just not in their system. So I received no correspondence in regards to a increase. Since XXXX	1
just paperwork that is pushed around from office to office. The short sale was initially denied	1
just said the sub-lender was XXXX XXXX	1
just send in the non borrower consent form & rental receipts which I did. I did n't hear anything. I went to make a payment and was told that my loan was sold to another company and OCWEN no longer was in control of the situation? I never got any documentation on this	1
just so that they can show us more delinquent	1
just that it has been 5 years worth. Per the FDCPA	1
just the listing of all the payments and dates the payments we made? So	1
just the payment due for XXXX month at a time. They refused to explain why the extra payment was taken and refused to put it back into my account the same way they withdrew it. This was an overdraft in my checking account. I have no resources to cure the overdraft	1
just the same and am fustrated with dealing with them.	1
just to conver their end. They are also reporting accurate information on my credit report. This company is a scam. They wouldnt listen	1
just to keep up	1

US Bank on the other hand basically told me "" too bad ''. I did as they told me to - call back after my loan due date. This was after 2 long trips XXXX. I was n't well and they were still not allowing me any options. They asked for my financial information. I explained I was looking for them to do anything other than just defer a payment during this difficult time. I 'm a single mother XXXX. I promised I would not be late the following month and mentioned I was going to put the house up for sale so I could take care of what I needed to. They said XXXX XXXX	1

Chase offered resolution of XXXX conveniently close to amount they took from my acct as a duplicate deposit and was my money sent during pretrial to qualify for modification and go into escrow then removed the amount causing deficit that was the basis of their holding all my pmnts made in a suspense account in a loss mitigation dept while I was told all was ok with my account and no statements or disclosure sent to me only statements with bankruptcy info which I was not in!! I refused the XXXX settlement and asked by attorney XXXX XXXX ( as well as same process with other XXXX attorneys ) what did I want to go back to Chase with I stated same as before the amount they stole	1

This is usurious and abusive. They are taking advantage on the situations of individuals and in the process also ruin their creditworthiness intentionally. They have no regard for agreements made on the phone with customer service.

An example of why I would make a partial payment is as follows : I am currently going to school full time and my XXXX is helping me financially while I attend school. A part of that financial help is that XXXX a semester they send me a housing check to help me pay for my current housing. The check is made out to myself and the mortgage company. I am supposed to sign the check and then send it to them. Because my house has been marked vacant	1

my account is still closed and I 'm showing as XXXX dollars past due! I desperately try to get anyone to help me. I called over XXXX times and each person told me they could n't help me and to call back. They gave me the number to the department who handles hardship accounts	1
my account showed a negative first because the tax refund hit my account after all the debits are posted even if it was the same day. I am so frustrated with BB & T. This is just a way for them to make {$36.00} from someone who has way more funds in their account than what they are spending. I feel like the need a 24 hour hotline just so you can call and make sure your purchases the night before wo n't exceed your direct deposit in the morning. I never thought I would get an overdraft fee at the same time when I have {$4800.00} sitting in my checking account. In some way this has to be fraud.	1
my account stated my deposit was there on another card I had previously but that one expired on XX/XX/2015. Since then they issued me a new caed which expires in 2018. This is still the case. I can not access my funds in any way at all. I get nothing but no explanations on the phone when you speak with agents. They are not in XXXX but outsourced from XXXX. They say they will call you back but they do n't. I still have not had any of my money returned to me since this has happened and there should not be any excuse for them not to update the card with the money unless they have taken it and are not saying so. My livelihood depends on my payroll checks	1

my attorney sent a complete financial assistance package to Wells Fargo on XX/XX/XXXX ( as per WFHM instructions to do so ). Wells Fargo Home Mortgage now has a special department to block people from being able to re-apply for assistance. The department is called the "" Re-Entry '' team and their sole purpose is to block ( Evade ) people from being reviewed again for assistance. To date that department is blocking me and refusing to allow my account to be reviewed for assistance. They simply state they will not review my request without the signed subordination agreement submitted to them first. They know this is impossible without them ( WFHM ) first opening a new review and if approved	1
my attorney was advised that my house was foreclosed on by Citi mortgage. I attempted to communicate with Citi verbally and through email and they would n't communicate with me. I sent I the XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX payments to Citi in accordance with the Modification agreement ( payments sent certified mail with return receipts to support payments made on time	1

my auto policy became wonky and there was some misinformation going back and forth. I spoke to someone in XX/XX/XXXX as I got a notice of cancellation. She helped me square things away	1
my balance failed to meet the minimum requirements and I was charged this {$12.00} fee. I raised the issue with BofA and noted that I could not transfer additional funds into the account and asked for the fee to be refunded. They responded that they would not refund the fee and I promptly transferred my remaining funds from the account and told BofA to close the account. After the transfer	1

So every other convo was different. Eventually it was n't handled so I went and Got a check myself and over nighted it. The check was dated for XXXX when the bank and car finance had spoken and Got each other 's information and pay off information and everything so they had been speaking. I had already started paying on this car again at XXXX XXXX ( mind you in 3 yrs that I had car finance I never missed a payment ). I talked to a manager who told	1

Customer service always after made me explain the entire situation	1

my escrow account had a remaining surplus of {$620.00} ( copy attached ). After several phone requests	1
my escrow amounts did not go up significantly and I took {$1200.00} out of escrow payments. The mortgage servicer knows what my homeowners and taxes are - they are close to the same every year - so how can have made such a big mistake in collecting the required escrow monies with the resultant shortfall of {$1900.00}. Now not only do I have to pay {$1200.00} to my insurance but I am pretty much still paying close to their original amount. This makes no fiscal sense. I tried to get them to see this and ask how this is possible but get no satisfactory answer. From a servicing standpoint it is their job to know the amount that would be required for escrow. As a consumer to be all of a sudden asked for an additional {$1900.00} out of my budget is shocking and unfair as I have been paying all along. There should have been little to no change.	1

The many delays in securing a loan modification made it harder to get help because the bank continued the process of foreclosing on your property while claiming they were attempting to work with us and just ignore the letters and notifications of foreclosure.

my monthly mortgage payment would increase by {$210.00} because my Escrow Account was in a deficit. I did not understand this and contacted the mortgage company.

my next payment will not touch Offer XXXX and Offer XXXX will revert to the 17.99 % standard rate.

Because the purchase was relatively small	1

my pay stubs are attached. SPS falsely claims I make {$9300.00} per month. It is blatantly clear that they have confused my file with another. I have additional income with a rental property.

my payment jumped and I was struggling to pay my bills. I did n't want it to continue climbing	1
my payment was increased {$100.00} in XX/XX/XXXX- not even XXXX days notice. My payment does not need to be increased. It was only because of their error the mess was created. Their mistake and I am penalized. Then I received another notice my payment would be increased {$100.00} in XXXX	1
my payment was made last week ( XXXX ) which was prior to my due date of XXXX.

no bank would do that. While I waited they called B of A and were stunned to find out that it was in fact true. Since that time I had to cash in CD with the new bank when my mother got sick and I had to travel to visit her. My new bank also had to penalize me for early withdrawal from a CD of the same amount. In this case it was XXXX months early. Their fee was XXXX. Yes XXXX. XXXX of the fee charged by B of A. That bank robbed me as surely as if they mugged me on the street.

no communications from Carrington. So we called to make our payment and the rep refused to take our payment if we didnt pay at least 2 months immediately. Refused to connect us with a supervisor claiming his supervisor was too busy so my husband left a message with no reply. I felt this had to be illegal and so I looked up this company. They are apprently scam artists and I am unclear why they are allowed to continue doing business in America.	1

no items to sell and I just use the account to receive money from an US citizen. I have never used the account for something else. I respectfully explained that to them but they can not understand	1
no job	1
no letter period that indicated that they would seize my funds. This account holds ALL of our funds. This account has a third party listed on the account and 100 % of wages of this third party. This has caused us to not be able to pay our bills including our rent which is due on XXXX XXXX. If our funds are not put back we will be facing eviction.	1
no letters	1

no matter how late it was using the automated teller service	1
no matter the circumstance.	1
no matter what we did the company would claim that we were behind on payment being deceptive then if we send large amounts of money then we would go back too normal payments. There was times we sent thousands of dollars or even hundreds. Then we would still get XXXX over and never get the same amount due each month. We have never had the same amount due each month so therefore we could not budget our self cause the loan company was so crooked. They would claim that we could send a fax for a renew of lower interest then they would claim that they never got the packet. We then were sold too XXXX and they did the same thing but worse	1
no matter what. Her answer : Refresh your browser and try again in a couple of hours. I asked her to put me through to technical support and she said there is no technical support. I have twice tried emailing the company at three different email addresses - XXXXXXXXXXXX	1

no missing payments nor late.. Also attached is a letter from Chase HAD Research XXXX XXXX Department ( dated XXXX XXXX XXXX ) apologizing for not posting this payment on time and also I am told that the late charges ( not being removed ) may have started Because of this. My present XXXX XXXX report page ( attached ) shows that Chase is telling that I am late since XXXX XXXX. I have also attached My bank statements showing all payments each month and on time since that time. I am outraged that no one is looking at my evidences. I am about to be fraudulently foreclosed on because Chase Bank is a ______________. I am at the public libraries with a XXXX yr old car ( in need of repair ) with no monies for gas and my days are spent here because I am being XXXX out of my home by a _________________	1
no monthly statements breaking down our payments	1
no new account. Back home again we lifted the security hold after paying Experian their {$10.00} ransom fee for doing so. It seems logical to me that when our data was compromised that the smart thing to do is place a hold on our credit. It is even more logical that if there are any charges for doing so the company or companies where your data was hacked should be financially responsible for everything. All we see happening is they lay off their liabilities to some "" insuring '' agent who then says if your ID is stolen they will work with you to fix the problem. Gee thanks	1
no new balance ( balance never changes even after they get payments ). They argue that I have the wrong understanding about the contract and they they do not recognize what the dealership gave me. Only what is on thier computer screen. I have noticed that there are others on a blog site that are having the same problems as I. Surely they can not change my finance terms without me signing a new contract.	1
no notice to XXXX Lien Holder	1
no office in NJ to talk in person. By pass XXXX to make calls to me XXXX times a day for months. Problems not resolve	1
no one at Nationstar or XXXX has responded. The XXXX requirements were sent to both parties on XXXX. There has been XXXX response or even acknowledgment of the XXXX XXXX rules to list auctions on the XXXX. We can not see how Nationstar or XXXX are in compliance with any XXXX or the California Department XXXX XXXX XXXX. We were under the impression that a residential purchase contract was a binding XXXX. Nationstar 's ineptness to do their duties should not mandate our lives in such a negative manner. This was their mistake. They need to adhere to what they told us and see this short sale through with the offer submitted.	1
no one can provide me any information on why this is happening. This has been going on for over two years now. They place it with a collection company	1
no one could give me an amount due each month. They told me just to wait for modification to complete for monthly payment. So	1
no one could look anything about about the transaction. XXXX days passed and my account remained under XXXX. I received no correspondence either. I finally called on the XXXX day and was treated horribly by everyone I spoke with. I was transferred to at least 3 different departments and then made to feel like I had stolen their money	1
no one from Ocwen has responded and they still will not allow me to speak with the assumption department. How am I supposed to get an assumption if I can not speak with that department to ask questions regarding the process??? I am hoping this complaint forces them to talk with my attorney. It makes NO sense Ocwen says I have to apply for an assumption	1
no one giving us a straight answer. I told them to pay it immediately. I was then told	1
no one has a fax these days ). They said "" that 's it you 're all set '' 3 months later I 'm getting collection calls at all hours of the day and night while my grandma was on XXXX none the less.

no one has contacted me. Because of this lack of communication on CAC 's part	1
no one having any idea what the other groups needed or of decisions made by them. I was given conflicting information	1
no one seemed able to help. I again tonight looked to see if any credits have been issued regarding the fraud charges	1

no one seems to know that they are talking about.	1
no one wanted to listen or open a report	1
no one will assist. They have a recording that states "" We are here to help '' They have not. They will not. I will go public with these complaints and send copies to my congressmen. I also would like to know if there is a fear of backlash that is preventing the CFPB from going ofter such big banks as Bank of America.	1
no one will care for a long time. Am I making myself clear	1
no one within BBVA has the ability to inform consumers of what identity failures have occurred. It was recommended to contact XXXX directly to verify my information. I contacted XXXX and verified that all my identifying information listed on my BBVA application matched the information in my XXXX credit file. XXXX actually recommended that I contact BBVA to discuss any identity verification directly with them as my information with XXXX is correct. The information on my BBVA applications were in compliance with with Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act which mandate that financial institutions verify certain information about applicants	1
no one would give me a reason for closing my account	1
no online customer service available	1
no paperwork had been given regarding the loan and no commitment letter was issued and time was ticking away on my contract. We asked for an extension from the original close date of XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX. The seller 's agent called his office on XXXX XXXX and spoke to his manager. The manager XXXX XXXX told him that he had no evidence that a loan application was ever made for myself and my husband. This was a huge red flag. The seller 's agent called my agent who then called me. I called and left XXXX message for XXXX XXXX and forwarded him the first and last email from XXXX stating that this loan was moving along. XXXX returned my call the next day XXXX XXXX and told me that there was nothing he can do for me	1

no phone calls and I was paying {$1000.00} per month as opposed to my {$830.00}. Then all of the sudden I start getting automated calls. Then I got an alert on my credit reporting agency. So when I looked it up the mortgage company came up as XXXX month missed payment. I called Nationstar and asked them what they were doing and had to explain to them what the arrangement was. At first they had not record of that agreement. I asked for a Manager	1
no problem. Wells Fargo has been giving us the run around	1
no promotional period was mentioned. It was a regular call with a representative from the bank. At no time did she mention a promotion or offer the opportunity to pay off the balance early to avoid interest XXXX 26.99 % ).	1
no reason or specific answer could be given. The account was closed by me voluntarily ( not by the bank ) based on my knowledge	1
no reason was given why	1
no reponse. I have also opt out from any and all promotional inquires last year with Transunion. I noticed that XXXX inquire was just pulled on XXXX/XXXX/2016. I have filed a identity theft report with FTC.gov. I have place fraud alerts on all my credit files.	1
no report.	1
no representative can explain to me how my account is 18 months delinquent and continues to be more and more delinquent although I continue to make payments.

My realtor has saved all documents that have been sent since the very beginning in 2012.XXXX years of this is absolutely ridiculous ... .we will lose these buyers and the house will sit and rot ( it would have already If I had not kept things up ) if the bank does not accept this fair offer now.	1
no statements were being mailed to me. I also had my attorney to request this information to no avail. I had a request from my State Attorney Generals Office regarding this matter	1
no status and now remarks. SO I inquired and obviously disputed the account wit equifax	1

no water	1
no way.	1
no work at all. I sent ALL of there equipment back to them. Iam NOT paying a bill for nothing done!!!!!!! This {$100.00} dollar bill should not have been sent to me	1
nobody can explain or show proof as to why 5 years later after paying {$2100.00} on a {$1800.00} interest free credit card ... I now owe {$1900.00}?! That would be {$4100.00} on {$1800.00}. Please help me. This has ruined my credit and the collection companies are saying I still owe them money on a debt that NEVER existed to be sold!!	2
nobody said to us	1
nobody would question that it would be considered fraud. How is this any different?	1
non updated & erroneous balance on Ocwen 's phone system	1
non-delivery of what we agreed to receive when I signed up for this credit card.	1
non-published phone number	1
none has agreed to alter the statement concerning my short sale to Paid as Agreed. it is my understanding that since a borrower is not personally liable for a loan such as this	1
none have any payment history on any accounts that are in question. I have my past seven ( 7 ) years of bank statements and there were no payments made on those dates in fact no payments were made in those seven ( 7 ) years. I do n't know what is left to do. I 've disputed and contacted all XXXX XXXX	1

none of which have been returned.	1
none of which have to do with the file. They asked me for a Request for Mortgage Assistance ( RMA ) on XX/XX/XXXX and it was completed and sent to them the same day. But when I called them to see what the status of the file was on XX/XX/XXXX the US Bank folks told me they did not have the RMA and required it. I emailed it to tem again and apparently they found it	1
none of which respond back to my case	1
none was given. WE are XXXX XXXX and have combine income over {$7000.00} monthly income. We are able to repay the loan and other information was never collected or considered.

nor can he sue me for it. He said he was from a legal firm and would see me in court and hung up.	2
nor could they show me how to find it on their site.	1
nor did I agree to pay. I was told that the "" HUD '' contains information provided by my Broker ( who did n't show up to closing ) and all terms were discussed and agreed upon before submitting to the lender. This was absolutely not true!! I never received any information regarding such a high fee. Given the exorbitant amount and the lack of service ( ignored calls	1
nor did I give any of my information. 5 days later	1
nor did I need alltel as my home pH has been XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX years plus.	1
nor did I receive a denial letter	1
nor did I receive any of the requested information. In XXXX I received a notice in the mail that they had cancelled the debt and I had to report the income to the IRS on my taxes. This is incompetence at best	1
nor did I submit requested documents	1
nor did I trust the practice. A year later I went to a different XXXX office and they helped fix my teeth. We started over and took the XXXX that were put on my teeth by XXXX XXXX. I have talked to other consumers and they agreed that XXXX XXXX is running a very bad business. I did n't report this sooner due to not wanting additional stress. I want people to hear this story	1
nor did I use any of the electricity I am being billed for. You may contact the XXXX XXXX Court house in XXXX Ohio to verify this information.	1
nor did i ever receive a phone call or notice of payment from the collector.	1
nor did they attempt to re-bill us before sending it to collection. PCS tells me they did not buy the debt but had it sent to them by XXXX XXXX XXXX. They also say they paid the full amount to XXXX XXXX XXXX as soon as we paid the bill	1
nor did they follow procedures to provide me the opportunity to validate the debt	1

nor do I write checks ). The rep was good enough to run my name through their database	1
nor do they provide any form of customer service. Their only actions are to steal form unsuspecting customers.	1
nor documentation. I have never received any documentation on this loan. I was assured XXXX times ( XXXX verbal	1
nor does it direct to other pages to read terms and conditions.My question is when I opened account over internet with their promotion code and they knew from their records I have already basic checking account why they did not deny even if I overlooked it. From my standpoint I met all the conditions that they stated on Promotion front page and even Citi representative wrote me I have met all essential conditions so I must get award around XX/XX/XXXX but with latest communication Citi denied.I have copy of that letter too which I can attach or copy paste later. To satisfy their conditions it took me 3 months in my seniors. I consistently was supposed to maintain high balance of {$50000.00} to avoid paying monthly fees. To do that I took money out of my nest egg saving with XXXX XXXX where I got around 1 % interest but interest here is negligible.So I been loser in old age from both sides	1
nor emails. If finding this out today	1
nor filed according to the regulation. My current mortgage is insured with a title insurance company	1
nor give consent for. I do not see how it is legal for them to charge me closing fees for buying my mortgage when I did not ask or apply for a refinance or anything. I was not behind on mortgage payments to XXXX and actually pay extra principal with each payment. I can not fathom that it is legal nor proper for these mortgage companies to charge me legal fees and closing costs for a mortgage that I did not apply for. Please get back to me soon because they have already ripped my off for almost {$600.00} for these fees which I did not ask for.	1
nor had HSBC automatically converted these points to credit my account. I do not agree with the banks improper decision of terminating my account without giving me ample time to manage my earned points. I appreciate your attention to this issue and look forward to receiving your comments / help in order to get back what I own..	1
nor had a delinquent payment over the course of the loan. The loan 's servicing was recently sold to SLS over the past 9 months. Unbeknownst to my husband and me	1
nor had my calls returned. This constitutes awful business practices and unprofessionalism. Eventually	1
nor has a dispute even been initiated by me.	1
nor has it paid for any repairs	1
nor have I ever been diagnosed with this condition used for the medication. They continue to try and collect this debt from me	1
nor have I ever had in my possession any documentation from this company proving any kind of debt. I am offended by their attempts to contact and feel that	1
nor have I ever visited the State of XXXX nor do I know of anyone who lives in the State of XXXX. I currently work fulltime for the State of XXXX and have done so for the last 27 consecutive years.

nor my final payoff statement. I asked him to get manager assistance and he stated the manager could not find it. The man said he could send a payment history	1

nor notification received regarding the status of the loan. Messages are left and not returned.	1
nor refund the excess	1
nor sign any agreement	1
nor the company would not give me my items even though I offered to pay the fee. The items were destroyed.	1
nor the interests charged on the late fees. It is sad	1

nor the real and beneficial party of interest for the above loan.	1
nor verbal	1
nor was I able to view my account summary. The Macy 's credit card website state it was undergoing construction and therefore	1

Most companies send multiple letters or correspondence trying to resolve their issues before taking things to this level. I do not understand how people can do business in this manner.

nor was I notified by them. I was assured during that conversation by the Supervisor of the supervisors that the forms would be send XXXX and this time would have a return XXXX envelope to expedite the return from me. Today is the XXXX day and I have received nothing. I have a call in to them but there has been no return call. This bank is very untrustworthy and misleading I am now having to contact legal help to get this resolved.	1
nor was our attorney or the chapterXXXX trustee. How can you indebt us for something that we were never notifiedof in the first place? I also received documentation stating my payment wasgoing to increase XX/XX/XXXX from {$1200.00} to {$1300.00}. I spoke withOcwen yesterday and was told my payment is supposed to be {$1500.00}. Also	1
nor was there ANY insurance payment made to any insurance company. The last taxes were paid by me in XX/XX/XXXX ...	1
nor website where I make my payments. obviously	1
nor will it ever be due to them. I have complained multiple times and have reached out to Ocwen customer service and their research dept but have gotten nowhere. In an effort to save my home I applied for a modification which was recently approved however they still have not removed the XXXX in "" fees '' and as such my payment has gone up considerably. While I am grateful for the modification offer	1
nor would I expect them to	1
nor written confirmation that the amount would stop the sale. I confirmed several times with XXXX XXXX XXXX at Champion that {$18000.00} was correct & on XX/XX/XXXX I sent XXXX cashiers checks totaling {$18000.00} to their XXXX MI office as instructed ; I sent it via overnight XXXX & have XXXX delivery confirmation for XX/XX/XXXX. Since XX/XX/XXXX I have called nearly every day to confirm account is current & to request breakdown of what the {$18000.00} paid for. I have detailed notes of who I spoke with & when. XXXX reps	1
normally over {$3000.00}	1
not 2 years. SOOO now I have no home and am told I must wait another 18 months to get a home loan. I add insult to injury I am a XXXX vet. What the XXXX is going on with this country? What can you do to help me own a home?	1
not Wells Fargo. I want them to transfer the name on the appraisal to XXXX XXXX so I can continue with the refinance of my mortgage. Wells Fargo is also who I have my mortgage with now.	1
not XXXX	1
not XXXX & i never lived at the XXXX address this account was associated with. I am being threatened by this outfit & the lawyers of XXXX XXXX	1
not XXXX XXXX nor XXXX nor Synchrony Bank sent me any notice of the changes. I do not feel as though I should have to pay a penalty of {$500.00} plus late fees for a situation about which I knew nothing.	1
not a correction of the Bank error.	1
not a law	1
not a lender at all and they never were. I talked to the credit bureaus and they advised me that XXXX is suppose to remove any negative items if hey do not have proof of ownership from XXXX. If XXXX were to sue me	1
not a physical mailing address to send certified- return- receipt	1
not a revolving credit. Every month	1
not a single dime owed by me or my children. All of my credit card bills are paid in full each month	1
not all eligibility factors were evaluated.	1
not as in forbearance as should of been. Indeed	1
not being able to leave voice mails and more	1
not borrow and owe no man nothing! I hope the person reading my email do n't take offense. I 'm frustrated and disappointed that I 'm penalized because I tried to do the right thing by paying my debts. If I filed bankruptcy I would be in a better position. My co-worker is just one of many stories I 've heard. The message of it 's better to bankrupt than to pay up is being heard across America. Will someone take a stand and make these agencies be more accountable for the information they report and more accessible to the pubic?	1
not both. The representative continued to speak in a demeaning and rude manner. I requested to speak to a supervisor. A supervisor came on the line and again	1
not cost deferred	1
not covered or supported by documentation earlier.	1
not due to my error but theirs for not sending out the proper documentation for me to pay my mortgage ( on recorded line	1
not even a GFE	1
not even on the last day	1
not even once. It 's just devastating.	1
not even showing that I was late online. THEY STILL KEPT CALLING. Then	1
not extended warranties such as these. I have an email from Zales stating to take receipts to local Zales store for full refund and also spoke with a rep named XXXX who also stated the same and even called the store to advise them to issue full refunds. He spoke with XXXX	1
not for rent	1
not hidden. So since the bank sees this as an incredible profit opportunity	1
not him	1
not home owners.The XXXX XXXX investors have lost more than XXXX total. There are hundreds of other defective TIC real estate loans that have damaged thousands of XXXX investors across the country. Nothing is being done against the banks who wrote loans that were used to defraud investors and perpetrate XXXX abuse.	1
not immediately reporting these XXXX accounts as disputed by consumer to any credit bureau	1
not knowing they sold the loan. What is our best course of action? We do n't have the cash on hand to make a payment to the new servicer	1
not knowing what else to do. Then the next day I look at my deposits which consisted of XXXX checks and {$600.00} in cash and none of it was in my bank. I went down to see XXXX to ask what happened and after much computer and phone investigation he found out that all my accounts were locked and were being closed. When I asked why	1
not leaving messages ). After a few more attempt calls to speak with a live responder - that where in fact continuously being transferred to XXXX or XXXX XXXX voice message - I 'm confident that I left XXXX messages on XXXX XXXX answer machine. Again	1
not liable on the debt. Despite repeated phone calls disputing this debt ( going back to XXXX though they first have it documented in XXXX XXXX	1
not listening to the customer	1
not me	2
not mine and not to contact me regarding this ever again. I then called the XXXX about it and the owner	1
not mine.	1
not my Paypal account. The debit card on file with them was no longer valid	1
not my landline or my husband 's phone. I do n't answer any caller I.D . that is n't recognized by my contacts list. I 've had this phone on the DO NOT CALL LIST for over XXXX years!	1
not myself	1
not on the County information and actual tax bills. County is returning payments and the escrow balance will be increasing for years	1
not on the due date. This I mind and getting tired of keeping track of something that I ca n't just pick up the statement and see it in writing.	1
not on the list of debts in the bankruptcy not included in the discharge of debts. The man just kept repeating that the mortgage was included regardless. If that was the case it would have been listed in the court documents. The man made me feel like I was a dead beat.. I did file a chpt XXXX and only included debts incurred by my deceased wife.The mortgage was never included in the chpt XXXX bankruptcy..The bankruptcy was discharged in XX/XX/XXXX all the while payments were being taken out of my bank acct by XXXX.I tried repeatedly to explain this to the man at Nation Star he became belligerent. He told me to contact a lawyer that I was wrong.We have made our payments each month to Nation Star.Yet we have people driving by our home taking pictures and this all started when the mortgage was sold to Nation Star. I do not like the harrassing phone calls every month..we are making our payments and will continue to do so. When I googled Nation Star on the internet there are numerous complaints about this company	1
not once	1
not once has XXXX ever contacted me	1
not once has any of this ( alleged ) debt ever showed up on any credit report of ours	1
not only Taxes and Insurance which is the normal	1
not only did they not bother to reply to me	1
not only do I have insurance	1
not only for myself	1
not only has Green Tree Servicing denied any and all of my multiple attempts to settle this matter	1
not only has this left me with a big debt on my shoulders but it 's emotionally tolling.	1
not only increased my payment to cover the interest rate increase	1
not our issue. '' I was disgusted and canceled my card on the spot. Customer service was indignant and stated that "" Citi is the largest bank in the world so we are always marketing ourselves. ''	1
not pastdue	1
not pay all the back interest. When I looked up the deferred interest time for my last bill for last summer that I am being charged {$700.00} interest on	1
not posting notice in local paper	1
not realizing all those payments would be due and payable XX/XX/XXXX. I work in education	1
not realizing no one would work with us and this could not be rewritten. We do not want the loan forgiven we just want a reasonable interest rate	1
not receiving any XXXX then or since	1
not related to the business relation between the bank and I	1
not rented. I told them I would clear this up with XXXX	1
not sure how much that will be. Now it will be on my credit report for 7 years. They have n't contacted me in 4 years	1
not sure if this correct or not but i did n't think i would have to pay to get a loan modification	1
not surprisingly	1
not taking into consideration tat I was enrolled in the forbearance plan with those creditors. This situation was and is in violation of the fair credit reporting act.	1
not the amount required to pay the loan in full. '' When asked	1
not the creditors	1
not the high rate of 35.94 %.	1
not the law.	1
not the reduced income to occur in the immediate future. Second attempt	1
not the rest of the "" mistaken '' late fees.	1
not the {$1000.00} payment	1
not theirs	1
not them. It is forcing me to consider another refi 12 months after I just did it. This will cost me {$3000.00} but it saves me {$12000.00}. I could pay off mortgage but would get hammered XXXX by income tax. ( XXXX with withdrawl	1
not to bill the full amount for services. I disputed the charge via XXXX XXXX 's charge dispute services. XXXX did respond to the dispute inquiry	1
not to have responded in writing	1
not to mention money in faxing them documents and the inspection fee	1
not to mention ruin my reputation in a community I have worked hard to establish a name and a business. They know how to locate me! I had just talked to them! I told them I have every intention to get my account paid up and will do as soon as I can. It may be another 30 days	1
not to mention the XXXX hours I have now spent on the phone trying to get this resolved and an additional XXXX minutes each way just to the store. This is highly unacceptable. I have met my legal requirement to get this matter resolved. I scanned into there system the paperwork and evidence that they require for resolution which is above and beyond the legal requirement to get this corrected. They have caused adverse action to be taken against me within XXXX hours of there mistake and could cause additional adverse action to be taken that XXXX not be reversible. I am already being told that additional inquiries will be necessary in order to reverse the adverse action once the correction has been made by XXXX which will further deteriorate my credit score.	1
not to mention the cost of living ( rent	1
not to mention the numerous times I was disconnected and had to start all over	1
not to mention the personal information used for marketing sharing. I am on phone with card company canceling and am also now told that the 40 % had a {$150.00} cap. I know what I heard as well as telling rep I was off to "" spend a lot of money ''	1
not understanding the incredible interest rates or the way that I would not be able to increase my payment schedule/pay the principal down quickly -- - although the agent I spoke to assured me that repayment was easy. I received the {$300.00}	1
not unlike the one I was lured into in the first place ( please see attached	1
not until I received my full credit report.	1
not updated!!! I do n't even know what it 's for! I 'm upset and outraged that they are allowing this to happen. For the past few years I have never made a late payment or allowed an account to go delinquent so this is ridiculous. There 's not even a telephone number to contact this "" XXXX '' account	1
not what they advertised. I submitted a review online to XXXX XXXX	1
not {$3200.00}	1
notarize them and include copies of my trust pages which I did. Now I received a second letter from XXXX XXXX	1
notarized witnesses copies were delivered to them on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX my loan was transferred to Roundpoint Mortgage Servicing Coprporation. I contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX just to let them know about the loan modification. Roundpoint asked me to email them a copy of the loan mod docs to speed up getting the information put into their system. Since that date	1
notary and the signatures. With all the research that I have been doing with TILA	1
notary in Utah	1
note date is due on XXXX	1
note that transunion and experian are reporting the item correctly as "" included in bankruptcy. i asked equifax to provide the document from XXXX XXXX showing late current payments so i can provide tham to XXXX XXXX but they would not provided it.	1
note the original credit limit was {$950.00}	1
note went up more. Now sold to ditech	1
notes of phone calls	1
nothing but challenged the valuation by the appraiser. The reviewer 's work was shoddy and even Ethos said he was out of line. The first appraisal was in line with other sales in our HOA development and we provided proof of this. But in spite of this	1
nothing has been resolved. I told United coll bureau on yesterday that I retired on XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX and have no funds to pay because their records are incorrect. I also requested an updated history of acct fr their office. The supervisor refused to speak to me	1
nothing in writing	1
nothing is past due. I have gotten over XXXX calls from their collections people in the past 2 days	1
nothing resolved. I ask my my credit limit to be re-instated.	1
nothing showing my DOB or SSN. It had an apartment complex manager 's signature	1
nothing was received. Now I have other so called debt collectors contacting me about some obscure debts. I do not know if Velocity has shared my information	1
nothing. from XXXX till now I have only received one tax bill and that is for XXXX. It is classified as a business. Escrow questions	1
notices	1
notified all XXXX bureaus	1
notifies me in writing every XXXX if there is a change in my XXXX and subsequent payment amounts. Going back	1
notify each bank and credit bureau and have them send removal request ''. Experian is affecting my interest rates and potential to obtain credit	1
notify me after the card expires that my account has not be renewed. Why are they not required to do it prior to collecting the fee? To add more insult	1
notifying me that they were attempting to collect a debt. In response to their letter and repeated auto-dialer calls to my cellular telephone	1
now	1
now 2 years later we look at my credit report and their name as well as the {$59.00} balance is on there as active	1

I have been fighting this since XXXX and again they continue to report these negative hard inquires as they of not pertain to me. I have also sent letters that remain uploaded to the CFPB portal that I have filed against the companies that had relevant information to be reached at stating that they too have requested the inquiries be removed and yet they are still being reported. Again all of this information was faxed to them as requested XXXX. Please note that I have exhausted all methods to cure the matter and they refuse to do anything further.

I have received conflicting information from them and they completely ignored the assistance I could have received from Keep Your Home California that could have helped me catch up! I was told by their Manager XXXX XXXX that he didnt have time to talk to me as he was busy interviewing people becasue they needed more people to answer the phones. He also told me they werent going to help me and that I should have savings in the bank like he did	1
now they are wanting me to pay closing cost to refinance. Chase should honor the original loan application due to the failure of the loan officer inability to communicate with me in a timely manner concerning this loan.	1

The fine is {$100.00} a day. The Initial investigation goes back to XXXX XXXX. I intend to name	1
now with the delayed processing of US Bank I ca n't transfer funds to cover these returns either because they do it at the very end of the day and then charge the fee. What happened? How can the processing change and delay two to three day without letting us know. How come they are not entering things as the use to once it clears over time and have it show up prior to business hours in the morning so we can transfer funds to cover theses items. This is just XXXX more of those banking scams that allow them to charge obsorbert fees and get away with. I should be able to relay on a processing schedule that has been followed for years and not be bounced around with these types of changes and without notice.	1

numerous calls	1
numerous escalations and a complaint with the CFPB	1
obnoxious and un professional. The company claims to not have our paperwork and they clain we are over {$16000.00} in arrears. This is totaly false. Our pleas fall on deaf ears. When we call we are directed to XXXX. And I refuse to speak to this person any longer owing to his rude and crass behavior. We have fullfilled the terms of our loan agreement. But Freedom refuses to speak to us about this and they instead threaten to foreclose on our house. This company is impossible to work with. During one phone call XXXX asked if my wife was home. I told him no. Then my daughter entered the room and spoke to me. XXXX then relayed to me that he knew my wife was at home and he inferred that I was lying to him. Experiences like this are very much the norm with this person and this company. We have read XXXX complaints online from other consumers who have been subjected to similar treatment. We do not want to lose our house	1
obstructing	1
obtained and completed trial payments on. Take a good look at what you have attempted to do and make the proper correction by sending me the permanent and final documents to sign for the Hamp Tier 2 PRP loan modification. I can go on about the steering me into a different loan that you say I applied for on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Which I did not do. Then you state that I am denied for all XXXX loan mod options in the letter datedXX/XX/XXXX That noted I had until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to reapply for anything else. Sure enough my application was submitted ( not by me ) and on the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX morning XXXX hand delivers A package. This is what I was expecting a month ago. The problem is this is for the loan I did not apply for. These are final documents for the newly approved Standard Trial to Modification program The terms are not fixed. That is a XXXX step arm that is {$2700.00} a month and the total principal owed jumps up from $ XXXX to $ XXXX. This offer is much higher than the affordable HAMP TIER 2 they approved and said I backed out of. Would it make sense for me to back out of a helpful Hamp loan mod to reapply to get this one you sent me docs for?? I did not change my mind .I did not withdraw and I did not reapply for this other loan. Please make my Hamp mod permanent.	1

I can not begin to tell how disappointed I am with this entire situation. I have tried to contact them numerous times and conveniently they are not available.

He then told me that I was not even eligible to recieve the {$300.00} promotion that I was signed up for. The consultant told me that the only incentive I was eligible for was {$200.00}. After discussing my issues and frustrations he just told me that nothing could be done and that this was the best that he could do. A few days I called PNC to ask them when I would be recieving my money and the representative told me that I was not eligible to recieve the {$200.00} or any of the other previous incentives I was signed up for. She said that she needed to contact the PNC branch to further review everything and that I should be recieving a call from the assistant manager by the end of the business day.

That I was not to make any changes without calling them first.	1
on property at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
on separate occasions	1
on several different occasions throughout three years. I informed them that my divorce lawyer was recommending I declare personal bankruptcy ; however	1
on several occasions he continually told me my payments were being returned from my bank but my bank was telling me that there were no signs of the payments coming through. I would inform navient of that and at that point navient would send the payment again and it would be approved by my bank. Well my last payment was shown approved on my navient account but navient said it was sent back and my account is being sent to a collection agency now. I honestly feel my payments were tampered with on purpose and I never received the opportunity to properly start my repayment plan. I understand that the loan was in default but I honestly was trying to repay in the best possible way I could. I have my payment records which show I was starting to make regular payments and I stayed in contact with navient but it never seemed like they were interested in helping. I honestly want my loan to be brought of default status or at least be allowed to make the payment arrangements. If you all can help in anyway	1
on that occasion they threatened "" further action '' if I did not pay the measly {$120.00}.	2
on the XXXX application	1
on the XXXX page reflects that Ocwen reported to the credit bureaus on XXXX XXXX 2016 and our account is current. Per the payments and amounts due statement from Ocwen reflects our next payment is not due until XXXX XXXX 2016 for {$690.00}	1
on the XXXX site I noticed they responded to the XXXX and I absolutely dispute what they sent. I have never requested a deed in lieu. I never cancelled a short until the buyer I had from XXXX XXXX of XXXX finally cancelled. As far as cancelling a short sale in XXXX of XXXX I was trying to pursue help with loan remodification and there was no short sale paperwork going on. As a matter of fact I would receive letters telling me that due to Bank of America not receiving all requested paper work they were cancelling things which then led to me calling again to ask what they wanted as I sent them everything they asked for everytime.. My realtor also had great difficulty receiving information and responses from Bank of America. In spring of XXXX we went through months of sending and resending documents due to them wanting new wet signatures on everything that had already been signed. I have been talking with a XXXX XXXX at Bank of America and we talk at least once a week but still nothing is being resolved. She did tell me she would send new paperwork for loan re modification XXXX but I still have n't received that either and if Bank of America does n't resolve the issues of money still being charged and etc that I have requested Bank of America remove/write off I do n't know how anything will be any different. In the meantime	1
on the XXXX the representative confirmed the account number was indeed my account	1
on the advice of XXXX separate attorneys and with their help	1
on the bank 's side	1
on the fourth attempt my husband stayed on the phone with an actual person until he received it via fax at which point we were told foreclosure had already been started and there was nothing that could be done. OF COURSE NOT!!	1
on the guidance of a Wells Fargo 's agent XXXX XXXX	1
on the last day of each month	1
on the more recent try	1
on the other hand	1
on the police report it did state the XXXX banks XXXX Bank and XXXX Bank but you only mentioned that you deleted XXXX. Your consumer report dated XXXX/XXXX/15 is attached as proof. Now XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
on time	2
on time and the first time I had financial problems they took advantage of me by having me pay to skip payments to protect my credit only to state later that the verbiage on my letter was not exactly what they wanted so I was reported as 60 days late. Then	1
on to the street in the cold. And SLS is being allowed to get away with it	1
on top of that I was charged a new XXXX overdraft fee and both payments for {$17.00} and {$30.00} were returned. I made these payments prior to US BANK miscellaneous debits to my checking accounts. Really I had already paid these bills before US BANK did both miscellaneous debits for XXXX to each checking account. US BANK returned my bill payments back unpaid and US BANK pay themselves and charged me more overdraft fees. So now both companies are going to charge me overdraft fees because US BANK returned payments although they were already paid in full. I already paid those XXXX bills with a debit card and the money was there and I had no outstanding balances. This is so unfair to me and this has to STOP TODAY. I have never filed a complaint against any company because I try to give them an opportunity to redeem themselves and make things right. I first called and tried to talk to managers at the XXXX XXXX Ohio branch. Also I called the department I set up the payments with and XXXX kept sending back to the other XXXX between the branch and that department. On XXXX the XXXX XXXX manager refused to refund overdraft fees even though US BANK cause checking accounts to be overdrawn. This is not the first time it was done in the past not that long ago. Now it is time to put a stop to this behavior because seems like things are out of control now.	1
on which they still require me to make minimum payments. I have a loan balance of {$21000.00} and have no idea how I will be able to keep up with this. I feel as though I was a victim as well as other students who have already had their loans forgiven. The way the company went about handing these loans out to young students who know nothing about them	1

on-time payments	2
on-time payments since I refinanced. I have my mortgage statements from Wells Fargo showing this. Also	1
once I completed college	1
once I had been approved for a loan modification	1
once I was employed I paid and/or settled all of my outstanding debts ( more than {$70000.00} )	1
once a destructive burgler has entered your home	1
once again	1
once again deception ; this collection agency has no contract with me	1
once again that I 'd have to go through the dispute process and it would take 10 to 45 days. I 've NEVER had any kind of issue like this with any other bank or card. I 'm moving this weekend for a new job in a new city and that money is needed	1
once approached with this idea	1
once by phone and a second letter after submitting a dispute letter.	1
once my account was 15 days past due they were unable to provide me a direct customer service line or transfer my call out. I do not believe this company should be able to withhold information on my account due to it being past due	1
one account I never opened	1
one appraiser came home and evaluated it as {$320000.00} ; however	1
one can use the points to book hotel rooms through XXXX XXXX	1
one day after the release from stay in the bankruptcy court	1
one day before our conversation with her. Then she advised to wait at least 1 to 2 weeks to get the Appeal removed and this way start my Loan Modification Request but that I needed to called to go over with her my documents and make sure she had all updated documents and from their she was going to placed my loan for reviewed again for loan modification. Most important we asked what was going to happen with the Foreclosure Sale and she advised us that the Foreclosure was Suspended	1
one must present both a credit card number and driver 's license. Since I was in Utah and had control of both my card and driver 's license	1
one of the billing partners refunded the {$600.00}. Then I paid {$69.00} for the XXXX machine and supplies. That should have ended the matter	1
one original lender	1
one to their XXXX XXXX and another to their physical address. And	1
online	6
only -- so those who pay online -- which must be most everyone -- NEVER know about this until they alert you after it reaches some {$5000.00} or more. When I called they said	1
only Equifax. I have disputed this twice with Equifax. I have asked them their method of verification. They refuse to remove it	1
only Federal loans will cover your two years of XXXX	1
only XXXX the amount paid to the plumbing company has been disbursed till date.  I need to repair my home as soon as possible.  Please help me ensure that Green Tree Servicing sends me the remaining XXXX to repair my home as soon as possible."	1
only XXXX was put down and XXXX wanted me to give him XXXX in cash for his pocket. His exact words were	1
only a first name and an employee ID number and when I referenced the manager 's ID number no one knew who I was talking about.	1
only a general statement of various possible methods with vague and unspecified procedures. Actions are FCRA 623 violations. Equifax even went so far as to remove my current address from their records after making requests for method of verification	1
only a notice of "" shortage '' in our escrow account	1
only a partial payment was due on the XXXX. A Ditech representative called me on XXXX XXXX. I spoke with her and told her I would include the past due amount with my XXXX payment. Several days later	1
only fraud is true. I have provided sworn statements and proof of jail for the crime. Crime has paid for Chase so far whom as made over {$15000.00} in interest over the few years this has been going on. They lie in letters sent out as well. The CFPB is the government oversight for credit card companies now. You guys do n't do anything!!! You send a pocket email response that says you wo n't do anything	1
only getting contacted with their overseas customer service	1
only left a message. He was very unprofessional	1
only six days after the due date of XXXX XXXX.	1
only that I wanted proof of accounting of the debt	1
only the amount due each month. Even though my loan was approved	1
only the interest rate and the mortgage monthly payment amount which I was happy with since it was going to be very low compared to what I was previously paying. There was only a few pages that I had to sign	1
only this vague and ridiculous message. If XXXX wants to investigate something why not investigate the fraudulent companies who charged my card without permission and I am sure did the same thing to others	1
only to be made out as if we are criminals in later conversations	1
only to be removed a few days later	1
only to be told after several weeks something is missing	1
only to be told that we do not have equity and were not able to refinance. XX/XX/XXXX my husbands partnership of 15 years ended and he was now unemployed. Without an income	1
only to be told they were never received	1
only to be told today that the address that Citizens Bank provided was incorrect. I am now being asked to complete and resubmit forms a XXXX time. The additional cost of the insurance is significant each year	1
only to discover those letters were sent in error and the application was still in review. I 've never been given any detailed answers on what the delay is	1
only to find out I was in the wrong type of dispute ( disputed for fraud ). I attempted to contact Citi and was on the phone for over four hours with them as I was being transferred from XXXX person to the next. It was extremely frustrating because XXXX person was contradicting the other and then I 'd be transferred again. I 've been trying to get a payment history and a balance of what my amount should be	1
only to find out that I could not schedule online banking with PNC to pay this loan unless I had a PNC checking account	1
only to find out that they company that is refusing to remove this negative mark has been sued by the FTC and lost. They were sued for unfair collection practices	1
only to find that the funds were received and not allocated ( for XXXX	1

I purchased a new home in XXXX and last month I attempted to refinance my home and was told by the lender that an alert was placed in the FHA XXXX system stating that I had a property foreclosed on and that it made me unavailable to refinance under FHA for 3 years. This property belonged to my ex and I should in no way be harmed behind it. I was told I 'm held liable too but that its impossible as I did not sign off on the deed in lieu of foreclosure therefore invalidating the deed. I was told I did n't have to sign papers since the property was given to my ex in the divorce. It can be XXXX statues to adhere to. Either its mine too or its not. If my signature was needed and was never obtained then the deed in lieu is not valid. I ca n't be penalized with him along with his property as it is not mine.

saying they lost the fax or in one case "" my signature was n't dark enough ''. The document with the supposed signature problem was to request my tax returns from the IRS and that happened months ago. There were also some repairs ( adding a missing handrail and such ) that I needed to address and have done so. Now that the repairs are complete I am being told they found something on my tax returns ( this is months later ) and they need me to fax my original tax returns or they ca n't close the loan. I did a little checking and what I realized is that the interest rates have gone up and what I believe is that they keep stalling hoping that my rate lock will expire or that I will get so frustrated that I just go somewhere else. A friend recommended the CFPB. All I am hoping for is that someone contact Amerisave and verify that I am not being scammed and maybe motivate them to close the loan and honor the rate I have locked. Please note that ( after the fact ) I read some reviews on websites and have found that I am not the only person to have this problem with Amerisave.	1

she 's XXXX	1
she advice he go somewhere else to cash it	1
she again told me there was nothing that I could do about it and said I would not be allowed to speak with another supervisor.	1
she agreed that I indeed asked was it hard or soft pull and that the company should not reflect as a hard inquiry only as a soft. After asking for her assistance to remove the hard inquiry she then stated "" well I 've been working here for years and you 're the only person to say we show up as a hard inquiry on their credit. There is nothing we can do about it and this is n't the company for you. '' I told her to cancel my membership with this program because I do not want to be a part of it. The documents I signed were under false pretenses therefore this company needs to remove this hard inquiry off of my credit. After speaking with Equifax 's manager XXXX and researching similar cases I decided to contact XXXX legal department. I called their legal department on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and spoke with XXXX. He explained to me he never handled something like this so he would have someone call me back. I received a call back from XXXX in the executive office on XXXX/XXXX/15 he stated he would have to see if there is anything he could do and he would give me a call back within XXXX hours. I never received a call back from him. I called XXXX and left a voice mail on XXXX/XXXX/15. XXXX never contacted me. I then called him again on XXXX/XXXX/15 and left a voice mail and called me back that same day ( XXXX/XXXX/2015 ). XXXX stated "" XXXX is not willing to admit they are at fault. I would have to pursue a lawsuit and or do a complaint with the credit bureaus. However if I decided to do those things XXXX will not admit to any wrong doing. '' He also stated I did n't call XXXX back until two days later to ask if it was a hard or soft pull	1
she apologized and refunded all the $ XXXX-charges. Despite the corective action taken by the branch manager	1
she apologized graciously and mentioned that she could do it over the phone if I had about ( XXXX ) fifteen or XXXX minuets	1
she arbitrarily set the credit limit at {$4500.00}. My dog had a rough go of it and ended up staying at the emergency clinic from XXXX XXXX on Saturday	1
she asked if I was calling her a liar and she said she had a picture of my house with the notice attached to my door. I asked what I had done wrong and she said "" you know what you 've done between XXXX and XXXX '' and an officer would be at my door in XXXX minutes to arrest me	1
she asked me to send in a notarized copy of the situation and then I opened the billing dispute. Weekly I have been contacting Citibank with no resolution	1

she became very upset with me and sent me XXXX very nasty threating messages. To take further action	1
she being the patient at the XXXX Idaho	1
she believes that she should be shown a statement or some sort of proof instead of being told they do n't have those records. We did contact US Bank over the phone to inquire about this and were told that this information could only be completed in one of their offices.	1

she called the loan officer 's manager and the following day the mortgage loan officer called me XXXX XXXX XXXX ) to tell me that I was XXXX or XXXX payments late in the last 24 months. When we met with him to formalized the application that should not be a problem to obtain the refinance	1
she can not disclose that information and I have to be transferred to a specialty department so someone can speak to me to disclose what the problem is. XXXX I had to disclose my personal information and now they just accused me of stealing my own identity. I told her I wanted her name so that I could get to the bottom of the matter or either she could disclose to me what the problem is and she continues to apologize but due to the nature fo the call she has to transfer me to a specialty department if I want the information disclosed. I finally ask her once more she has a choice and basically refuses to give me her name and tells me that due to the nature of the call that there is a possibility	1
she confirmed that is a common practice. Umpquah will provide a pre approval letter even if they know the buyer is not pre-approved. She went on to say it is my fault for not asking the right questions and just taking it for granted the pre approval was actually a pre approval. She said they do n't want to lose a buyer to another lender if they do n't provide a pre approval letter. I told her I think she is doing something against what the guidelines of the CFPB by providing a pre approval letter with zero income documentation. She said she is not doing anything wrong. The seller had a bidding war and chose this buyer based on pre-approval and other terms. If the buyer was not pre-approved	1
she confirmed that the request was pending	1
she could see our escrow account	1
she could tell me anything she liked about my ability to get approval. I asked what the procedure was for receiving loans and was told unclear repetitive information that did not specify credit scores	1
she did n't have access to anything earlier than XXXX 2014. How convenient. She said I can still attempt a Deed in Lieu but since my house is already up for sale I just wanted to finish out this option first. After submitting the shortsale information	1
she did n't realize fires do n't leave one 's computers and printers functional.	1
she discovered that XXXX had completely different first XXXX digits of the debit card number ( wrong first XXXX digits were XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and only had the last XXXX digits correctly. XXXX asked me to file a claim with Ally Bank	1
she emailed me back saying the loan was cancelled-she did n't realize that everything had to be completed within 21 days of initiating the request	1
she even tells me what i am calling about. in the end she puts in wrong so i have to now call back and get it applied to the principle. if i do my monthly payment on line and i make it for more than the amount do	1
she explained I 'd get a refund from my old escrow as well as skip a payment	1
she explained that this would benefit me a a lot better	1
she forwarded the emails to me and I am faxing to RCS. I called RCS mortgage again on XXXX XXXX 2015 and spoke to XXXX and explained this situation again and she needed me to fax in the documentation so RCS could follow up on this situation	1
she had confirmed the amount went from {$18000.00} to {$60000.00} and could not reason why the amount changed so drastically. She responsed I will get back to you with that change in value.During this time	1
she has all of my documentation. ( XXXX ) XXXX case # XXXX. I also sent all of my documentation to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX expert with the Virginia Office of the Attorney General.. ( XXXX ) XXXX. Ocwen recently sent me a letter through their attorney	1
she has been VERY rude and flippant about returning my money! I spoke to her on XXXX/XXXX/16 about getting my money back	1
she has been out from the office many days and now I had to contact XXXX XXXX from the investors office. He 's responds was just to let my home sale because I have a sale date for XXXX XXXX. That this will be a better option to just walk away. I started to cry when he told me this. I dont want to be homeless I told him I was going to file a complaint with the consumer financial protection Bureau and he told me that I can do as I please. That my home was going to sale either way. I want this adress. I have proof in writing of all the wrong doing they have done. Please I am begging for help. I do not want to be leave homeless. Thank you so much and I hope you help me with this awful situation.	1
she has no reason to order that	1
she has not received it despite my XXXX additional trips to the local branch. During XXXX trip to the branch	1
she has purposely witheld my funds even after being made aware that the funds are exempt and required me to lose wages by having to go into court to show a judge what I 've already provided in my initial CFPB complaint. She has placed a Lien on my property for a debt that is below the amount of XXXX dollars which is not at all how collection agencys treat people with debts. I not only have already had my personal information shared within that company due to my XXXX	1
she hung up on me again.	1
she hung up on me. I still never got an explanation of what is was for.	1
she hung up on me. I then reached out to an upper management officer	1
she hung up on me. I think they are sending out letters to try to get suckers to pay debts that are n't theirs.	1
she indicated there had been a mistake and that I only owed {$70.00}. I asked why I owed this amount and after a lengthy explanation ( none of which made any sense ) I told her I was concerned this was a scam. She asked me if I wanted to speak with a supervisor and put me on hold. Very quickly someone else got on the phone and informed me that I did n't owe any money and apologized for the inconvenience. I do n't know how these people got my medical information	1
she informed me that this statement was not correct and on XX/XX/XXXX another statement was generated. I do n't understand how the numbers could change in 10 days	1
she insisted that she did ... this harasser threatened every time that she called that she was going to send the allegations forward ... I told her to send it forward and that I contacted my friend and gave her the information but I was not giving her number ; now it 's between the XXXX of them and if she calls my number again	1
she instructed me to submit a letter of employment in Georgia and a letter stated that the house was not rented XX/XX/XXXX/ The last XXXX documents will help my case before HUD for the modification. On XX/XX/XXXX I faxed the statement letter and my attorney sent the letter of Employment on XXXX. The same week	1
she is a supervisor	1
she is having problems trying to help me pay as well. Dad went from a {$XXXX} an hour job	1
she is refusing to show the method and findings of an investigation concluded in less than 10 hrs after receiving the ID theft and police report. I plan on hiring an attorney to sue these people and need your help in obtaining their names etc so I can file a complaint against them in federal court. I have just received a very large inheritance and I now have the money to hire an attorney. XXXX of the acts is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ER XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I I have spoken to him he has never treated me	1
she kept going back and forth between her supervisor and I and eventually came back and said there is nothing she could do. I asked to speak to her supervisor and she transferred me. I then spoke with XXXX of collections and explained my financial hardship to him and he said there was nothing he could do. I just find it very upsetting that we are trying to do the right thing and make payment arrangements and they are unwilling to accept anything from us.	1
she laughed	1
she made me sign a new lease just incase. Well	1
she makes threats about taking me to court and garnishing wages from my job. what I mean	1
she nor did Aafes care about by time sensitive matter. I had to wait the allotted time until my reply email was back at top to be answered. The following day I called again in hopes to reach a more respectable	1
she noted that Ditech did in fact receive the payment	1
she pulled up my account told me how much my direct deposit was	1
she put me on hold ( or so she thought ) and proceeded to call me crazy and make fun of me to her coworkers for XXXX minutes. My house was paid off	1
she refused to even address that : "" I 'll be happy to discuss your account when you make it current? What 's stopping you from paying today? '' Well ... calls from a robot asking me to hold ... calls on my business line that my bookkeeper answers and says Citibank is holding for you? '' How is this even ethical and who is a collection agent to call me at my unlisted and -- Citibank has promised to remove this number -- but will not tell me how they got it. They have only acknowledged receipt of my myriad of emails. XXXX and really every Citibank representative is hostile	1
she refused. i gave her the reference number and she said she would remove my name from their list. I asked her what list and informed her that if she is acting as a debt collector	1
she replied	1
she replied no. I asked to speak to a supervisor	1
she replied that it wasnt and that she would call everyday	1
she requested that I send yet ANOTHER package in order to have my file reopened for deed in lieu consideration. I have made numerous calls to Cornerstone 's loss mitigation department and each time I have been told that I am not allowed to directly speak with the underwriter and that my request will be changed from a short sale to a deed in lieu request. With each phone call and representative I speak with the story changes regarding which documents are required.	1
she responded with	1
she said	3
she said "" the XXXX took 7 days to go from XXXX to XXXX ''. I disagreed with that statement and said "" the customer is supposed to get 15 days notice ''	1
she said I did not know what I was talking about and refused to answer my questions about the loan. I requested to speak to a supervisor and XXXX XXXX got back on the line. He refused to speak to me or answer my questions. He stated that manager XXXX XXXX would be calling me later that day	1
she said I was urgent that I called within 2 hours. I called XXXX	1
she said New York XXXX places the responsibility for clearing a lien on the customer. After pointing out that I live in Maryland	1
she said because there was XXXX question I answered wrong and refused to talk to me further and said "" if I tell you which question you answered wrong	1
she said it was too late. When I told her I would complain to the FBI	1
she said it was valid at the time to collect on it but the Statute of Limitation of Debt Collection in Texas is 4 years. She was asked how could they send out a XXXX without notifying us of the alleged debt	1
she said just go to the closing and the man with the papers would answer all of our questions. We went to the closing	1
she said maybe I should wait to make that payment until I actually get my permanent papers. I told her no I was told not to miss a payment then XXXX ( my service manager ) said make the payment I was making doing the trial XXXX	1
she said no it was incorrect. I was out of town	1
she said no. But then again assured me I 'd receive my monthly statements. No statement in XX/XX/XXXX. I needed to call them myself in XX/XX/XXXX to make them aware	1
she said she could not help me with any other type of arrangement and refered me to Cottonwood Financial	1
she said she would gladly take the payment and then I could have this removed. After being denied once again for credit on XXXX/XXXX/16	1
she said she would have something sent out to me in 30 days and hung up. If she has my old address on file	1
she said sorry that was n't included in the bankruptcy. I told her well I believe so. She said that is a loan that did n't involve a credit check and was not reported to your credit report.I said ok and how much to settle and she said I would have to place you on hold and find out if the paralegal will allow this as they do want to take you to court. She then said you can settle today for {$710.00}. I said email me a copy off the charge I am being sued for	1
she said that 's gone. I know she would n't like it if some one are these companies cheat her out of your her money. Yes! '' I did send the attorney general of texas. The contracts and the release form. Yes '' XXXX XXXX and RCS committed fraud. Not one of these companies could tell me who was the lien holder are the not holder. The reason is there 's not one. Because I do n't owe any one any thing.I will send the contract to your service in a coulpe of days.	1
she said that I just would n't get anything else in the mail about it.	1
she said that is the way it goes & I told her that no	1
she said the account had locked up and I would have to email for additional information and she hung up. I was a little concerned because my emails had been hacked into. This did n't seem a secure method. Two hours later I called back and talked to "" XXXX ''. He said the problem had been corrected and had been caused by XXXX. The only people I ever talked to were at Equifax. He said I only had to pay {$16.00}. When I explained to him that all I wanted was a free credit report and that that was never given to me as an option. He said there was little he could do. When I asked for a refund	1
she said they were not. She would not allow me to speak to a manager. This whole experience seems fraudulent. I would n't be surprised if this company is doing this to others and I would like this looked in to.	1
she said. We have been doing every thing by certified mail and keeping documentation of such. No one at that company seems to know what the other person at that company if doing. We receive numerous correspondence from them that come after letters that tell us one thing only to be told something else. they are impossible to deal with.	1
she says.	1
she send me an email back on XXXX XXXX	1
she started asking can someone help me I let her know my family is helping me from becoming homeless	1
she stated that her company just got the account. When I told her that she was not following federal guideline as a debt collection agency	2
she stated that she could not determine if the spelled out amount was written as a XXXX or a XXXX.  Because of this she said the bank cashed the check for the lesser amount and that it was not a bank error.  Therefore	1
she stated that since the deficit between my income and expenses was for {$700.00} the only alternative they could give me was to stop paying my mortgage for 3 months while my situation changes	1
she stated that the investors can not approved the modification because I was found unable to pay. The house is scheduled for a foreclosure on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I am requesting your help to stop the foreclosure and to advocate for a positive solution of my case	1
she stated that there would not be a problem. We placed out trust and our families future in her. We have XXXX young children and our biggest concern was uprooting them from our home and end up having nowhere to call home. On XX/XX/XXXX we closed on our home. On Sunday XX/XX/XXXX I opened my mail and found a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX that my husband and I were denied for our loan. You can imagine our surprise. XXXX XXXX never contacted us and in tern we sold our home and have no idea where we are going to take our XXXX and XXXX year old children. When we attempted to reach out to XXXX XXXX the next day	1
she stated that they went up but only {$75.00}. Central Mortgage Company is supposed to pay Insurance and taxes so now my mortgage has gone from XXXX to XXXX over XXXX more a month which we were never approved for in the first place and we ca not afford even now. How can they burden us like this? Please help us.	1
she stated that they would go ahead and perform an expedited funds transfer back to my payment account for XXXX of the payments. This transfer was to take 2-3 business days. I confirmed that this request was put in when I called back on XXXX XXXX and spoke with XXXX	1
she stated the check is canceled and she will see to it. NOTE	1
she stated the same thing. She brought up the contract	1
she stated they follow their own regulations then put me on hold and did not return to the call.	1
she stated they only keep them for 30 days & did n't know why this was their policy. Her only answer was to remove my late fees but not to fix my credit.	1
she still would n't quote it to me exactly. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I was told that my online access would be fixed. I was told over the phone	1
she tell 's me that it will be 15 days for my loan application to be assigned to a processor and that if everything is approved can expect to receive the loan in XXXX. They have all my paperwork and thy have run a credit check. If I had been informed that it would take 2 months	1
she then placed me on hold for 15 minutes when another woman came on the line I explained the situation yet again. She stated well since you admitted to being a little late there was no error on our part	1
she then said she DID N'T need the SSN. This seems very suspicious.	1
she then threatened to then return additional information that had already been corrected and removed in retalliation. Her name is XXXX. She would not give any further information about herself or her position/title. I have been working with Trans Unition since XX/XX/XXXX to get this information corrected	1
she thought that opening an account for my wife is risky!	1
she threatened If i did n't pay it	1
she told me i would hear back in a day or two	1
she told me since i didnt want to write down the number	1
she told me that an offer packet would be considered only if it was received before XXXX XXXX	1
she told me that it should not be a problem they just had place a hold on my account and she asked me to see one of the tellers in the branch. So I went to them she told me that she would investigate it and she did and told me that they were closing my account with no answer as to want happened because she gave my the {$300.00} and something dollars that I had left available on my account. Later	1
she told me the problem was with XXXX and I was to call them and get it put on the credit report	1
she told me to go back to original creditor to get my validation	1
she took my HSA debit card	1
she was connected to the manager who stated she owed {$350.00}. They listed off her previous residence	1
she was going to do a conference call with XXXX. She got back on the telephone and said	1
she was no help	1
she was told that she was 5 months delinquent with a total of XXXX. Ocwen is not accepting payments or 2nd modification.	1
she was told they do not instruct lenders on modifications and the decision is completely up to the lender. An appeal was made to BOA and another RMA application was submitted. However	1
she was trying to interrupt me	1
she will provide emergency cash. I left the car and went to the nearest cafe to ask for exact address and zip code. When I called American Experss back	1
she wo n't say unless we confirm information which I REFUSE to do because I know her call is not legit.	1
she would checking to it. No one had called. We assume the account was closed. In XXXX XXXX	1
she would live in the house until she died and then the house would belong to him. I did not realize that this was a big error and I did not want to ruin my credit. I did not know what to do so I paid. In XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX the title company that my father now had to sign the loan	1
she would move my due date to the first of the month ( which it was supposed to be XXXX	1
she would not do anything about it anymore. when I paid off my contract I obtained a ledger summarizing my account	1
shhould also be removed	1
shingle prices increased causing an additional {$310.00} out of pocket cost to us. I believe their loss claim process is too onerous with the threshold set too low ( {$10000.00} ) Our claim is for a total of {$18000.00} making this a very difficult process. I own & gt ; 50 % equity in my home.	1
shoe less kids in XXXX. This will haunt me for the rest of my life. I will never forget this and it makes me cry everyday.	1
shortly afterwards	1
should I failed to make payments I would have been barred from classes.	1
should be paid in full and should be reporting as such to the credit agencies now. I feel that this is a violation of UDAAP as it was deceptive to pretend that they had entered into some sort of an agreement with me without ever speaking with me. I feel it is abusive to continue to collect a debt and even file suit against a debtor that has paid off their account. I feel that it is unfair to not send monthly billing statements to a customer and expect them to know what is owed on a loan. Service providers for large banks should be held to the same standard as the big banks.	1
should have been paid off at the end of XXXX. They also now want me to pay for flood insurance XXXX {$630.00} XXXX to cover {$78000.00}. I have contacted them numerous times and have been told someone will call me back. Still have n't heard back from anyone	1
should not be held against me. I was just Employee whom showed up to work one day and was informed that they would no longer need my services. I am in disbelief that something like this could ruin my credit and am asking for your consideration in reviewing this matter. I have documented the events that happened throughout the application process and am willing and able to share them with you in support of my case.	1
should not have irreversible repercussions across other lenders ... let alone a bank i 've used for literally decades without incident.	1
show so much as a late pay in my many decades of credit history. My FICO scores have remained high throughout the period TransUnion shows a bankruptcy ( XXXX ). This is obviously a clerical error on the part of TransUnion	1
showed her my Paid Off Receipt from XXXX	1
showed proof that payments were made to XXXX XXXX via bank statements. Was told to make pymnt to Green Tree instead which we did for XXXX	1
showed them that there payments would still be consistently on time based on my income and expenses*Balance on my mortgage is {$86000.00}	1
showing a charge off on my report. I discovered all of this when I applied for a credit offer from a retail store. Prior to this point I did receive a letter from the collection agency indicating the charge off from my Shell account. Believing that I had a XXXX balance	1

showing my wet ink signature	1
showing no damages to the carpets	1
showing our XXXX payment due on XXXX XXXX	1
shows XXXX and XXXX past due at 50 days and no foreclosure proceedings. At this point I can not make payments online or over the phone or get ahold of the contact. The next time I called to make a payment they would not allow me to do so without paying the full balance although they had a portion of the previous already in a suspense account. After calling repeatedly and leaving voicemails I spoke with someone else whom said I could only make a full payment or do a short sale. I said that I had been able to make XXXX before and wanted to pay. He said that the contact provided should not have let me make the payment and that it was a mistake. Imagine calling and being directed around to different departments that do not exist without a contact. It 's horrifying. So now we are in XXXX and the total due is {$7800.00} with unpaid XXXX with a note that the taxes disbursed XXXX include unapplied funds. No foreclosure proceedings noted. XXXX statement still shows the unapplied balance of {$1200.00} with overdue payments for XXXX with notes saying that foreclosure proceedings may have been filed and to contact them for the full reinstatement amount. Also notes on the last page that foreclosure proceedings have not been filed. At this point I had filed an application for a loan modification. XXXX shows no XXXX funds received and a payment reversal of {$1200.00} with the escrow balance still negative. Funds were not returned to my account nor applied to anything. Note on last page that foreclosure proceedings had been filed. XXXX while they were underwriting the loan mod they allowed me to make a full payment of {$1500.00} which was not applied. XXXX shows attorney costs of {$480.00} and unapplied funds of {$1500.00}. The only thing I got in the mail was from XXXX XXXX XXXX ; a certified letter addressed to no one with a VOE form and a note to scare a renter ( I 'm the only person in my home ) / I requested a payoff reinstatement which did not come. Finally on XXXX after still not receiving XXXX	1
shows late 150 day between XXXX & XXXX XXXX	1
shows that it is still "" processing '' but it has been deducted from my "" available balance history ''. How are there XXXX available balances?

So I was forced into signing up with their collections department 's program if I did not want them to turn my credit card account over to their "" attorney. '' I discovered that what they did was unethical and perhaps illegal.

since that time I have made 4-5 lengthy phone calls explaining their error and when was my mortgage payment for XX/XX/XXXX going to be credited. On each occasion they told me it would be credited within 48 hours but was never done. After several of what Nationstar calls courtesy calls	1

since the bankruptcy is gone from our credit records	2
since the fee itself created an overdraft from the earlier balance. When I received my paycheck that Friday	1
since then I called two times to see what was going on	1
since there is no mistake that they had no right to debit my acct. which has had a zero balance since XXXX	1
since they are younger than the 10-year reporting threshold.	1
since they said the LTV/CLTV was above XXXX percent.	1
since this account has been basically been satisfied through a third party	1
since this account was part of my bankruptcy	1
since this increase is absurd and will be a hardship on me and my family.	1

since {$5000.00} of the deposited check was internally not credited to my account. The overdraw of the account triggered a State Farm credit card overdraft protection transfer of {$600.00} on XXXX. The credit card fee charge for this transfer was {$24.00}. The checking account charge to receive this transfer was {$3.00}. The Bank states that the balance of my deposited check in the amount of {$500.00} was credited to my checking account balance internally the following day	1

siting a bankruptcy that does not exist. In XX/XX/XXXX I began refinance proceeding with another mortgage company. Nationstar received notification of such proceedings and only then did they report to XXXX	1
six days a week. I made the executive decision to suspend my coaching sessions wherein a representative would XXXX XXXX XXXX train me on how to build my website my coach agree. My sessions were nowhere near completion. Then without notice you switched my coach. The new coach ONLY mission was to encourage me to register new credit cards my XXXX name	1
slacken the housing market and depress the middle class. I 've written to navient XXXX times and an uninformed individual picks up the phone who never helps. Navient/XXXX//XXXX XXXX most likely got that XXXX they loaned me for XXXX for 0 % because of the federal Reserva q/e and I 'm fed up with how they 're taking advantage of the American dream	1
sladerous information on my credit report. This complete disregard for my rights under the law by both XXXX and Equifax has cost me XXXX dollars in higher interest rates and higher insurance premiums and denial of loan applications.	1
slander of title	1
slim chance bc I was given XXXX in pass. Every time I followed up my Relationship manager consistently changed over 20 dozens time causing dual-tracking to take place. I was persistent to get help so I can assume loan and get help so I can make my payments to avoid losing home for my young children	1
slow payment	2
snapping at her and demanding that she tell me to "" call her TODAY ''. My daughter is at school and feels harassed. I feel both humiliated and harassed. My physical illness is worsened with the stress these bills have caused me. I had to do what I had to do to support myself and my child. They were n't the smartest choices but I made them. I 've tried to scramble to come up with solutions but them harassing me is slowing down that process. If they show back up at anyone 's home ( because they are not professional nor do they follow privacy laws ) again I will remove them from my property myself.	1
snootily and with much disdain he and confirmed by his manager	1
so	2
so Chase can assume the client has forgotten about the incident	1
so How did I automatically become responsible for the debt?	1
so I 'm still paying the same high interest rate	1
so I agreed to it. He came back with a 30 year fix at 4.5 % and reduced my mortgage by {$5.00}. just recently another bank offered to refinance my loan and they asked me about the Harp program and they said I qualify for it and while processing the paper work an issue came up which disqualified me	1
so I am also not sure which amount to use {$710.00} or {$670.00} or something else? However the BIGGER issue when I have now attempted to make a payment and get the correct amount to pay they tell me the amount	1
so I am apparently out the money that I spent on the phone	1
so I am confident that if any emails had been sent	1
so I am lead to believe that somehow Transworld has hacked XXXX system to get names of renters or obtained personal information about me from XXXX somehow.	1
so I am not sure how I answered the verification questions incorrectly.	1
so I am not sure if they have the wrong person or what is going on with this account. However	1
so I am now facing Acceleration. I am being charged late fees	1
so I am scared	1
so I answer it. This is very deceptive.	1
so I applied for a modification. I was told the only way XXXX XXXX XXXX would not talk to me until I stopped making payments. So I stopped. After two years SPS tried to foreclose and put liens against my business. I started making payments again and was advised to file bankruptcy for the house only to stop the liens. I had to sign the modification papers before I saw the terms. This was done by Select Portfolio Servicing ( SPS ). I have n't missed a payment since. They said they had nothing to do with XXXX and XXXX said they do n't have my loan anymore. About 90 days after I signed	1
so I asked for a payback plan. So the same day they called to tell me I was denied	1
so I asked them to please investigate and let me know when that would be fixed. I called again in XX/XX/XXXX	1
so I asked to speak with a manager	1
so I ca n't comment on where things are right now.	1
so I call back. This time it had n't been sent because the stop payment had not cleared	1
so I called and emailed the Chase representative and have still not received a response. I am 19 months behind on my mortgage and not living in the house	1
so I called back an spoke to another person she explained to me that the company took over my loan XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why such a high payment she told me that they have not received a payment since XX/XX/XXXX	1
so I called back to the regular offices only to be told the same story	1
so I called back. I did notice that my balance had been diminished by {$2.00} from my original call. This third agent was at least somewhat helpful in that he told me that there as a {$1.00} fee per call ( the 2nd agent did not tell me this when I told her I would be calling back if I had not heard from them in an hour ) .He also told me that I could close my account without a fee by going to a BofA location. There is not one near me. I again asked to speak to a supervisor to now ask for the {$3.00} call fees to be credited in addition to the {$5.00} check fee. The supervisor	1
so I called on XXXX and found that "" my request had been denied because it would put me over the limit ''. As I do not receive a fee for over the limit I challenged	1
so I called the company back	1
so I called the number calling me back. It was a debt collector	1
so I called the number on the letter to let Capital Management Services know that I dispute this debt. They informed me they would send me proof of the debt. I received statements from them just before XX/XX/XXXX. In reviewing this alleged debt	1
so I called them again when I got a late notice	1
so I called them back and after 2 hours of waiting and being sent from dept to dept they said that they had finally found my records and that they would continue with the dispute. I was charged an additional XXXX in this time that my card was cancelled and it was applied to my card.. I told the credit card company that they said it would not be charged again. I then received a letter yesterday saying that the "" vender would only take off XXXX. I then called the credit card company today to say that was not acceptable	1
so I called. I was told that they would "" open a work order '' ( 8 days after receiving the proper paperwork? ) I checked again today XXXX	1
so I came here.	1
so I can live stress free. These dark clouds from my past keep coming back	1
so I cancelled the auto payments.	1
so I cancelled the process. Later I made another PayPal transaction	1
so I closed my practice and moved. I also closed the bank account that had autodebit for payment on this loan and contacted XXXX XXXX on several occassions to get the auto debit linked to another account. He never returned my calls and they continued trying to pull money from a closed account for the next 90 days which caused additional fees for overdrafts	1
so I contacted VanDyk Mortgage to find out why the mortgage had not been reported and no one could provide an answer. I emailed a representative a written request to have my mortgage reported and it still has not been done. I have made several attempts to rectify this situation and after 9 months	1
so I contacted XXXX to discuss delaying payment ( and late fees ) until a later time in the month to give me time to accumulate the funds. I was told that this would be acceptable and could pay at a later date. When I prepared to pay my bill	1
so I could ascertain how the payments that I made had been applied. I received no response from them. On XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX my son receioved notification that his federal tax refund of over {$1000.00} had been offset at the request of XXXX. On XXXX he received notification that the same XXXX loansad been referred to XXXX XXXX XXXX for collection. I wrote XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX disputing the debt	1
so I could n't figure this statement out. I also do n't receive paper credit card statements. Emailing did n't help	1
so I could n't get online banking until they sent me a verification card to my address	1
so I could n't sell it either ( which I could have done and sent the money to Navy ). I could n't just abandon the boat	1
so I could not ask for Validation within the first XXXX days. Secondly	1
so I could not pay for few months. I could pay after that	1
so I could speak to anyone who could help with a loan modification. Again	1
so I decided to press the "" give back card '' option and go to the XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
so I decided to test it. I tried to withdraw {$1000.00}. If he was correct	1
so I did my research and found out that my taxes and insurance did increase so the increased escrow payment was justified. Fast forward to XXXX 2015. I am now an unwilling customer of Carrington Mortgage Services. I received a new escrow analysis from Carrington stating that my mortgage payment would increase {$120.00} per month OVER the increase that XXXX XXXX XXXX had already implemented. I lookled up my taxes	1
so I did n't want to deposit the check in my Union Bank account	1
so I did not check on payments ( I had sufficient balances to cover payments and even if I did not my bank would have paid and charged a fee ). The automated payment had worked for the past few years	1
so I did spend {$19.00} on a small business XXXX I chatted with Amex rep in earlier XXXX	1
so I did. Today XXXX XXXX	1
so I do n't know how you can say it is late? Has First merit notused my money that I have already paid back on other investments to further theirbusiness interests? Had I not paid ahead	1
so I do n't understand why this bank is reporting me as Fraud to all the Banks	1
so I do not feel comfortable returning their call to gather more information. However	1
so I felt confident it was being applied to my account. I opened the account on XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
so I filed a complaint with the XXXX. I received a correspondence from XXXX with the office of the president who validated the account listed on my credit report. I filed another dispute with the consumer financial protection bureau	1
so I filed a report against both agencies they destroyed my debit card and I was issued another one. I have been charged {$29.00} and {$24.00} since XXXX 2014. I then called Experian but again just like XXXX they too could not find anything not even with my social security number. I was asked for the debit card number to be able to pull up the account. I called my bank obtained the number called Experian and that debit card number is tied into a person by the name of "" XXXX XXXX ''. I was then advised to go to my bank I informed them I already have but my bank will reimburse me for the last 2 months only. I was told by XXXX from Experian that they could not refund any amount. I told XXXX that their company is supposed to protect us from people like "" XXXX XXXX '' and from companies like "" Experian ''. I recalled enrolling to a travel agency company around that time giving my debit card number being charged {$1.00} for the first month and would need to cancel account so that I would not be charge on a monthly basis. I knew that I had enrolled with this travel agency so I cancelled my subscription but with these XXXX credit agencies I was initially charged the {$1.00} and they continued charging my account because I never cancelled my subscription. I never cancelled because I did n't know that I was enrolled with these agencies I never received any correspondence	1
so I filed for Social Security XXXX 2 months later ( XXXX XX/XX/XXXX ). I eventually was awarded XXXX	1
so I gave a detailed description of the problem to her Assistant - - XXXX XXXX. I also gave her my home phone number. As of now	1
so I get half of my pay on the XXXX and the rest on the XXXX of every month	1
so I had decided to contact them on XXXX/XXXX/15. They claimed to have not received my odometer statement. I promptly called the dealership I dropped the car off and asked that they resend the odometer statement to NMAC. I called NMAC back on XXXX/XXXX/15 to confirm that they had received the statement and was informed that they received it on XXXX/XXXX/15	1
so I had no way to verify that the account was taken care of. When I refused to make the payment and they told me that my credit will stay messed up until I paid the debt so I made the payment but the bad credit report still there. I am a poor student	1
so I had to look to private loans to finance the rest ( I am XXXX of XXXX children	1
so I had to sent the check to Seneca. And my real problems began.. I sent all paperwork as requested	1
so I have no idea how to get information on where we stand. My mortgage company wants the signed approval letter or they wo n't approve my mortgage either. How do I get Bank of America to move on the approval letter?!	1
so I have to pay extra every month so I do n't have late fees or late on my credit score.	1
so I hired an attorney and began the probate process in XXXX 2015.	1
so I know there is not a balance of {$22000.00}	1
so I know they made their money	1
so I made a payment of {$1200.00}. My regular payment is {$1100.00} plus {$33.00} for each late fee past XXXX. So I was told by XXXX that the balance for XXXX would be {$1200.00} plus the {$1100.00} for the XXXX payment. This total would be {$2300.00}. Called XXXX XXXX to make payment for XXXX for {$1200.00} spoke with XXXX who confirmed a balance of {$1100.00} due for XXXX. Called and spoke with XXXX who took the XXXX payment for {$1100.00}. I asked what was due for XXXX and was told that since we had been paying extra	1
so I made up a number and told them I was doing so. Then they tell me they have access to background information and the number did not come back as valid and they would not talk to me. I never authorized them to check background information on me. I never authorized anything. I cant believe for security reasons a fraud department is asking for social security number of PROFESSIONALS not financially obligated to the account. This needs to be stopped and now we ca n't resolve a fraudulent account which is against FAIR DEBT COLLECTION Practices and their regulations because I wo n't give my social. The client	1
so I may work with them to resolve. If it is XXXX XXXX Bank XXXX. I would think they would have initiated the reporting and would have responded. Not XXXX Bank that exists as a trade name only per the attached. I was told by the credit reporting agency	1
so I moved in with family and rented the house out to pay for the mortgage. I always paid the mortgage on time	1
so I never received a bill. ( Despite my ongoing efforts to communicate and negotiate a fair settlement	1
so I never signed it or returned it. Another problem with the XXXX is they were no longer willing to set up my payments with my pay schedule from work	1
so I opened up a dialogue again per XXXX instructions and with the law firm handling foreclosure on behalf of XXXX early XXXX XXXX. I was told by the XXXX law firm they had a mediation dept. that would help me work with XXXX to modify my mtg and help me get a more affordable mtg payment. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
so I paid via credit card for extra XXXX for XXXX loan payment. Then onXXXX/XXXX	1
so I paid {$160.00} in cash at the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XXXX. located less than XXXX minutes from my residence. I checked my bill pay first and saw that the payment was sent but the check never cashed ( nearly one month after it was sent ). At that time I was most certain the check was lost and would not be cashed. So I called my bank and cancelled the check ( {$29.00} )	1
so I put a stop payment on XXXX of them.  The bank charged me $32 to do this.  I have sent the proof to Ocwen and they have gone back and forth with me."	1
so I put the check into my filing cabinet.	1
so I reached out to XXXX XXXX	1
so I reapplied and asked for help or a workout with my mortgage. I have just got word back from Chase Bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX stating that I am 15 months ( {$15000.00} ) behind on my mortgage and they can not offer me anything type of help other than a short sale. Now for 12 months I made a total of {$5400.00} in reduced payments	1
so I requested a payoff statement. The payoff statement that they sent was incorrect	1
so I reviewed my payment and noticed they had been charging me PMI insurance under another name Borr Paid	1
so I sent an online secure message to Barclay 's	1
so I sent it again on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX which they also said they did not receive	1
so I should n't have to pay for it. These unauthorized charges add up to {$140.00}.	1
so I signed it and sent it back. My loan closed and refunds were issued on XXXX and all they returned of the {$15000.00} was {$4000.00} ( {$4000.00} for the additional gift my uncle wired plus the wiring fee of {$59.00} ). I was total by the escrow company that there were no additional refunds. I immediately went to ICM and was told by the branch manager that I would receive a refund check ... I have made several attempts to resolve the issue ... but my calls from the branch manager and or the corporate office have not been returned. I have been in contact with a loan assistant but he has no answers for me. I feel they preyed on me and deceived me. I not sure how many people they have done this to but they must be stopped and someone should look into their practices. I need direction on how to get my money back.	1
so I sought to refinance. Select Portfolio Services ( the service provider ) told me they could not refinance the property	1
so I started paying my mortgage roughly on the first of every month. On XXXX XXXX	1
so I still am completely unable to communicate with anyone at Seterus either by telephone or writing.	1
so I then called and cancelled the card that I had released the info on. These people are harrasing and I would like to know what I can do and whom I can contact to report this and I would like to take action against them if this is not a legit company for harrassment. Any advise you have will help ....	1
so I thought. Pay Pal apparently could n't collect from that credit card so they charged that Pay Pal credit again and again I do n't hear anything about it until its now in XXXX 2015 and now there are late fees that are attached doubling the amount owed. I again had to pay that yesterday. Now I hear that there is a class action against them for this same thing with others. Who do I talk too?	1
so I told him again that they could not reach the person they were looking for at my number and to take my number out of their system. He hung up on me.	1
so I took the best deal that I could find. Bad move.	1
so I updated online again and then followed up with a call. I received a condescending letter today	1
so I wait and unhappy with that I did not hear from Chase Bank. Why I had upset with someone did not show up. I felt bad disappointed with XXXX male did not show up .. I do not want alone filling out online and I do not want alone walking to Chase Bank that I am very afraid if there might or might not discrimanated against my appearances and XXXX ( XXXX ). I just horrible upset that I did not get {$750.00} and i was unhappy with XXXX XXXX XXXX. I do not want any XXXX worker at Chase Bank. I prefer XXXX Male works with me in ordering to open new account and I want XXXX male helps calling U.S. Department of Grants & Treasury in Washington	1
so I was charged the overdraft fee. Now after being guaranteed I would not be charged monthly service fees on my checking or savings account	1
so I went to XXXX XXXX	1
so I went to my other bank and gave all the bank statements and the my parents ( who gave some gift money ) had to run to their bank and do the same thing. I was never told about my parents having to hand over months and months worth of bank statements till the morning before the closing. Then 2 hours before the closing the realtor called and stated the title company was waiting for the documents. I tried to call the loan officer	1
so I would like that transfer to be honored. If not	1
so I would n't have to pay for a so-called shortage	1
so I would n't lose my property. Please investigate the financial structure in which the loan was underwritten and other stipulations in the agreement.	1
so I would not be responsible for their debts.	1
so I wrote the loan number on my check	1
so Nationstar stated the best option was the HARP Program. Enclosed is the email stating that I was approved	1
so XXXX years later we still find the lies and the run around. They are forceing us itnto forclosure. They are trying to get us to just give up. we have been now in contact with the executive office and are still recieving misinformation peolpe can not take notes properly and can not help with the process. This office has become just aother layer in the chase for someone to do somethig to help the homeowner.After speaking with an Exec office person	1
so a lawsuit valued at XXXX XXXX yielded XXXX net after all claims were paid out. As he was in XXXX for 3 months and unable to work for three more	1
so after I received the invoice I disputed them.	1
so after waiting about a half hour the assistant manager said she would look at it she gave me an entirely different explanation	1
so again I 'm not upset that the account was restricted	1
so again I applied for Restructured Solution through XXXX XX/XX/XXXX..SPS did not respond and in XX/XX/XXXX	1
so all I want them to do is significantly decrease the monthly payment	1
so as result I am underwater on this Mortgage with no light at the end of the tunnel. I am currently paying a 7.125 % interest rate. Interest for XXXX XXXX is {$780.00} and principal is {$280.00} = {$1000.00} + {$160.00} ( Taxes ) = {$1200.00}. At this rate I will most likely never be able to repay the Mortgage. The original Mortgage does not show up on the reports	1
so as the XXXX day was approaching I found that I would get paid my last portion that I needed on the XXXX day. I called Ocwen on the XXXX day and asked them if I could submit my payment on the XXXX day. They told me that would be fine. So I wired my payment from my bank ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ). They subsequently sent it back to me on ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ) and told me that I was too late and that now I owed $ XXXX+ dollars which I did not have. Since then I have been trying to work out a modification which they denied and find myself possibly facing foreclosure. They said that never received the funds. I have proof of the wire activities via my bank. They have ignored this and are proceeding to try to take my home.	1
so as to have trustee monitor our mortgage. Bankruptcy attorney	1
so as to maintain the "" status quo	1
so back to XXXX I go. Tonight I get a call from social media who states now I will get another escalation specialist. This man was kind but did n't even understand the terms of my Hamp Mod. I need someone to intervene here	1
so be it-but the consumer should have the right to know exactly what merchant is involved and what the violation was.	1
so by Chase 's own admission	1
so does n't qualify for federal loans.	1
so each payment after for 3 months were also "" recorded as late '' until I caught my mistake and made a double payment in XX/XX/XXXX. I sent a request in writing to investigate and remove the inaccurate reporting in "" Good Will '' as I have always been on-time with my mortgage and considering the new information. I also added automated withdraw for all future mortgage payments	1
so even if I did owe this company or XXXX any money	1
so everything should have been ready for the contracted closing date. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
so far	1
so far I have sent XXXX emails and have XXXX phone calls this month stating I sent a partial payment of {$360.00} and this amount has been placed in a "" suspense '' account and would not be applied to my account until I sent the remaining amount	1
so far each month I am incurring fees and charges. These are the charges that I have become aware I am getting charged every month regardless of how much I pay to this company XXXX interest ( which is acceptable ) past due fee {$39.00} along with a XXXX over limit fee. I was told by a friend that I needed to submit a complaint with the respective authority that oversight and supervise these type of abuses or deceptive practices from these credit card companies	1
so far from XXXX different telephone numbers ; XXXX calls in the last week alone from the following phone numbers : XXXX ( XXXX times )	1
so far information was confusing. Was transferred to "" XXXX ''	1
so finally about 3 months into the job loss they allowed us to do partial payments. We entered into the process of a permanent modification in XX/XX/XXXX. In the 12 months it took them to finally approve the modification they "" lost '' our paperwork twice	1
so for a third time i spoke with XXXX at LJ ross XXXX she again said that if consumers energy called them they would have the account deleted from my credit report	1
so frustrated with Bank of America did not send me a refund check to me without alert messaging to my smartphone	1
so glad I checked the report. The American public has no trust in these bureaus to do the right thing when you are not watching them. I did and look what happened	1
so good	1
so he agree to run a new XXXX by XXXX XXXX. The company did so	1
so he continues to work. This HUGE lie from XXXX XXXX has put an indescribable strain on our once fantastic relationship.	1
so he had to have been looking at old notes or something	1
so he has paid them roughly {$35000.00} in interest. He inquired about a refinance or loan modification in XXXX XXXX	1
so he has to start calling my work again. I feel threatened and he refuses to stop calling me at work. I can not block the call and he said there are XXXX attorneys in his office and they are n't going to care if I complain on him. He said he will not stop calling me at work because he needs to get this resolved.	1
so he left us a number to reach him. XXXX	1
so he opened a Work Order on XX/XX/XXXX and said disregard the Notice. I called US Bank on XX/XX/XXXX to make sure it was taken care of	1
so he secured my information from there. Bottomline : XXXX did NOT secure my permission to pull my credit. In fact he was specifically instructed NOT to pull my credit. I want the record cleaned up from my credit score with all XXXX agencies.	1
so how could I have that many late payments? It was both impossible and inaccurate. I had called	1
so how does it matter if the reciever is a personal account or business account ''. For which she didnt have an answer and she told me that that is how it will be. She also told me that she would escualte the issue but still the time frame will be the same.	1
so i 'm filing a complaint here. The money transfer was charged to my bank account despite the cancelation	1
so i asked them to please do so	1
so i being batling against the system on my own and thankfully has being working so far	1
so i called XXXX back and while the attendant was helping me she discoverd that my loan was paid off as of XXXX/XXXX/2015. Told me commerce sent payments on XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
so i called XXXX to see when my contract was up	1
so i did and each time i would call i was told that the computers were down	1
so i have n't apply for nothing because I ca n't afford another bill and my goal is to increase my credit not to lower it	1
so i know all about banking which includes credit bureau reporting. I worked with XXXX and XXXX in the dark ages and know how reporting is supposed to be done. The credit bureau reporting of VW Credit is horrible. It is not consistent ( monthly ) reporting and some fields are inaccurate and field accuracy is different between what they report to XXXX and XXXX. A big problem has been that they keep reporting my monthly payment wrong and also the date of last payment	1
so if we still wanted to leave a message regarding something else that could be done. I then went directly to our branch and spoke with the manager who was unable to give any information and stated that our accounts had no indication or notations that they were to be closed. She submitted an inquiry on our behalf	1
so in XX/XX/XXXX I paid RoundPoint. Then in XX/XX/XXXX	1
so in XXXX	1
so in addition to the {$100.00} payment and {$3.00} PayPal convenience free	1
so in effect there can be no collecyion since the wrongdoing was not my fault.I have contacted them and they have not responded. I want this off of all XXXX Credit Reports	1
so in fact WFHM never needed anything firm the IRS and could have allowed the Loan Mod that they had already said I qualified for and had started making payments on to proceed instead of stopping it. I believe that WFHM have violated both the Laws of North Carolina and Federal Law in regards to the sale of my home. North Carolina has a 10 Day Bid Upset period before this sale becomes final and that date is up at XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/2015. WFHM defrauded me on the matter.	1
so in their system it appeared that I never "" accepted '' the modification offer so Seterus had to "" resubmit '' my modification file. All of this took over XXXX months	1
so instead of falling to far behind I entered into a payment plan that increased my payment {$700.00} a month to catch up for the one payment behind.I paid my payment plan as agreed	1
so interest charges do not apply to thisissue. So where are the line item charges wecannot see?	1
so it 's like we did n't pay anything for all the years prior to the modification. ( XXXX original loan amount	1
so it could be done as fast as XXXX days. But simply informing us that they ca n't finalize the loan is an easy task to do but we did n't hear anything from them at all. Even my questions	1
so it could not be processed	1
so it makes it 94 % ..??? I asked where was this disclosed on any of the documentation	1
so it was n't a late payment leftover from XXXX.	1
so it would be a {$5.00} discount ( I think it mentioned on the bill ). I went to the bank and paid my bill at XXXX XXXX XXXX and asked one of the tellers for the discount since I had a checking account with them ( I closed my account later on but still kept my safe deposit box ). The teller told me it would n't be any discount and the fees on the safe deposit box went up to {$40.00}. I paid the {$40.00} ( I still have the receipt that proved I paid ). The price was not a problem because I transferred my safe deposit box from XXXX XXXX to the XXXX so that it would be more convenient for me. On XXXX	1
so long as a deposit of {$1000.00} or more is made within 60 days of the account opening date. The promotional ad and terms do not indicate that any other action is required other than depositing the required amount within that time frame. I have attached documentation showing a deposit of {$2000.00} on XXXX XXXX	1
so my money was not in there on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I phoned them and asked for that {$130.00} overdraft fee returned and they said it was not the banks error so they would not return the fee. I said it was the banks error because they paid my bills early and they disagreed. I told them I would file a complaint with the CFPB and they said they would give me {$99.00} back	1
so my service was terrible	1
so not expecting that anything at this late date can be done	1
so now I 'm out {$270.00}. I finally went thru my bills last night and totaled up all I have due with store cards and all and it totaled {$4000.00} plus over an {$800.00} water bill from when we had the leak in the water pipe	1
so now it is having a negative impact on my credit that I worked hard to obtain and build. I can not refinance my truck to make my payments lower to save more money because of a report that was made before the 30 day period. I would like to find out why this was put on my credit report and see if I can get it taken off because it is negatively impacting my credit. I have a car payment	1
so of course that meant nothing to me. Through diligent efforts	1
so on XXXX XXXX	1
so right now I 'm still in the appeal process with the State attorney 's office. So this should have not been sent to collections until fully resolved. Now I got this central credit services calling and there very loud and abusive for something that is still in dispute and they keep sending letters.	1
so sad ' about the truck not working. The repairs of the engine are almost {$2000.00}	1
so she can login and look at them. After researching information online	1
so she knows that I am aware of the debt	1
so she opened up the case for me again. I waited and still no correspondance	1
so since I received no emails- I figured we were good. 60 days passed ... XX/XX/XXXX. I assumed as I had been told that the credit was no longer "" provisional ''. Suntrust waited until 2 days before XXXX to do the reversal	1
so that 's not possible ''. To which I responded	1
so that 's plain to see that theres a run-around scam oney racket in banking still ago! Please request to them to send me the {$2.00} that is to be left in my accunt and then close it? Thank you!!!	1
so that I can see who signed for it	1
so that I could have taken the necessary actions to avoid being closed. Instead they closed my account without any warning.	1
so that I know it was received. Have heard nothing so far. I do believe they are in violation of the stay granted by Chapter XXXX and are also in violation of FDCPA by calling my cell phone. They also need to research their bundles of debt they buy to see how many are in Chapter XXXX.	1
so that amount showing on my credit report is incorrect.	1
so that i could not see them steal my moneyThey have been stealing my money secretly. i	1
so that is why you will see different amounts. But I attached my run down from XXXX	1
so that payment was also outstanding. Finally on XXXX XXXX	1
so that they can start loan modification process	1
so that we could get it straightened out. I was reported to a collections agency. Then I was told that it was for the installation of the line ( that is n't what the bill says - it indicates a months worth of service and state tax	1
so that you can have an up date on what 's going on. They are call XXXX XXXX XXXX and their number is XXXX	1
so the bank disregarded my request and sent my bank negative by {$5.00} for their bank fee	1
so the bank sent me to obtain a "" Affidavit for Collection of Personal Property '' I filled out the paperwork	1
so the dealership overnighted them one on XXXX XXXX. I called to verify that a payoff was sent to GM Financial and the dealership claimed one was sent out on XXXX XXXX	1
so the hearing has been continued but not yet rescheduled.	1
so the new higher amount was charged-off and sold once again. This new debt grew again	1
so the next month bill accumulated.	1
so the short sale is denied. I just called them	1
so the total adds up to my full payment. Both payments arrived on XXXX/XXXX/2015 on time	1
so the value of the house has only gone up since we bought it.	1
so there is a pattern. I get all of my other bills	1
so there is no longer any outstanding debt	1
so there was no way for me to know that. In the meantime	1
so they agreed to redo my agreement and let me pay them back monthly	1
so they are already aware ( or should be aware ) that their behavior is inappropriate and likely illegal.	1
so they are not refunding fees. We feel that we have been scammed and given only part of the story. We want to protect ourselves in this situation. What action of the CFPB caused the banks to stop supporting the XXXX XXXX program? Will the program be resuming as indicated in our call to them? If it will resume	1
so they can get more money or try and kick me out. They are refusing to work with me even though I qualify. I also have requested all documentation such as the Appraisal of the property and the original Good Faith Estimate with their fraudulent figures in it. And any and all documentation they used to prove to me why they denied me. They have yet to produce any of their documentation. They attached a document to the last complaint	1
so they cancelled all my credit cards hurting my credit making remarks that I was a resk to pay them back	1
so they do have the correct address ). None of the checks ever arrived. I called again on XXXX/XXXX/2015 and spoke to "" XXXX '' who said he would transfer the money directly to my bank account. I gave him my bank information and double-checked it with him	1
so they do n't offer it although its an incredibly simple enhancement to make to their site at Chase.com.	1
so they have XXXX XXXX dollars and tell me I need to pay more to get the refund of my money	1
so they have the lap top and wants more money	1
so they held the loan in their portfolio - and made us pay the higher interest for those 8 mos. In XXXX they paid my escrow from the old loan	1
so they know you do n't have the power to go after them. If you start negotiating a settlement they will say yes but then say now you owe me more for all other fees they make up. Bunch of scam artists and they claim they work with numerous real estate companies but in reality they have no one! We would love to have more complaints to file a class action lawsuit against them and get other stories from those that borrowed money from them at one pint or another or been through other horrible situations with Middlegate Funding.	1
so they simply do as they 're directed - by WHOMEVER gives them direction - in this case	1
so they started to offer assistance. It took 18 months before they approved me for what they called a loan modification	1
so they still neglected against me with deaf and other reasons due to my protection privacy requests. Totaled Unresolved Problem with these above	1
so they wanted me to pay more then I was supposed to in XX/XX/XXXX. when taking my payment they tell me it kicked back out that they couldnt take it until safeline discharges me	1
so they were changing my contract. By the end of the call	1
so they would no longer take any payments.	1
so they would not take it. I am currently two months behind on my vehicle note and one month behind on my mortgage. I am consistently behind on something every month so that I can try to catch up another. I can not ever get any help from these people. They always put it on my co-signer	1
so this XXXX 2 yr contract should never have been started	1
so this firm has made a false statement regarding its disposition on this matter. Further	1
so this is a big deal for me while I 'm sure it is an insignificant one for the Bank.	1
so this is my next step. They insist that this is my wrongdoing and refuse to accept that they are the ones that have made the mistake. They have wrongfully denied my family and I the protection from fraud by unknown individuals	1
so to off set this I paid advance 2 month on my mortgage and all went well for almost two years	1
so we agreed on it and we came back the XXXX day to close the deal and be done.	1
so we agreed. Currently	1
so we called and asked if this was correct	1
so we cant re-finance. I have submitted the proper documents to Ocwen in a timely manner. Our most recent rejection was today. We have sixty days before the loan matures. It took less than two weeks for their decision. Because of our income we do n't qualify for a govt program	1
so we got a form from a Texas State agency so that we would be exempt from paying school and property taxes but	1
so we had to add my daughter 's income to show more income so they would approve us	1
so we know we have n't missed a payment. We have called XXXX different times trying to clear up this issue. The first call we talked to XXXX and she said she would look into it. Two days later on the XXXX call XXXX suggested we FAX them our bank statements to verify the payment was made. We FAXED them that day. On the third call XXXX told us they did n't have a record of us ever calling them	1
so we opened a savings and checking account with a small branch of Wells Fargo	1
so we opened up account	1
so we proceeded to ask for a rate reduction due to SCRA Act. At first	1
so we replaced the roof with a 15-year comp roof. Not shown is the banister that we added to the stairs leading to the bedrooms. Not shown is the new wood stove. We have also attached portions of the signed agreement with First Horizon that substantiate our statements.	1
so we scheduled the appraisal per the officers instruction. The money was taken out of our account without knowledge of the date. We then received a letter stating that we were denied the loan	1
so we sent a check in the amount of {$1200.00} to cover the additional escrow and eliminate the increase in our monthly payments. The check was negotiated by OCWEN and applied to our account ; however	1
so we signed it. I know as buyers we should have follow-up with the request	1
so we signed the agreement. The current mortgage company demanded that we pay the balloon payment the XXXX month they had the loan	1
so we thought we were paying off this aid in our new payment. However	1
so we thought.	1
so we went to Navy Federal Credit Union to verify the check was real. I was helped by one of their representatives whom I asked "" when the check would be clear '' the representative responded "" Within a day. You should have it by tomorrow. '' They assured me the check would be cleared by the next day	1
so what is Equifax doing illegal?	1
so what is wrong here? It ca n't be the amount going to them	1
so when I called Experian they told me I needed to call back to the bank to figure out "" what model they used to pull the credit score? '' He would n't let me make a dispute or speak with a superior and kept telling me to call back to the bank. So I called back to XXXX bank and they told me they do not give out those information nor can find out how to find that out. I need to find out where they obtained this credit score because it has denied me a credit card and also affect my credit inquire.	1
so when XXXX County received the duplicate payment from PNC they put the funds in a holding account as they do not automatically return duplicate payments. XXXX county send a letter to the party who they received duplicate payment from notifying them that the taxes they were attempting to pay had already been paid	1
so when she past away	1
so why is XXXX moving this account around which has reached its statue of limits for reporting this account.	1
so why should n't the government be held to the same standard? Example : Toll charge 1= XXXX Toll Charge 2= {$26.00} Total for that invoice is {$88.00}. Late Charges are {$70.00}. A total amount of {$150.00} was sent to ( in-house XXXX ) collections. Collections attempted to collect on {$150.00} while I had {$100.00} surplus balance in my toll tag account. In addition	1
so with our brutal winter there was additional damage done to the subject property in the amount of {$90000.00}. XXXX refuses to re-evaluate the value as this was already done XXXX. But the damages have prevented us from getting a $ XXXX offer. They are informing me the Borrower needs to file an Insurance Claim	1
so with the interest rates going so low we decided to look into refinancing our home. We met with a Chase Mortgage Banker	1
so you can rectify the problem. Their reinstatement department is very poor	1
so you either leave a voicemail that is never returned or get an error message that does n't allow a message to be left. Unprofessional business practices .I have contact a law firm XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX TX XXXX	1
so you must have access	1
so you still owe these fees. '' I paid them each around {$10.00} "" interest '' but I do n't understand	1

sold the home for {$1500.00} for the taxes. no one notified me of any of this until much later. greentree finance was notified even befor the house was sold yet did not let me know. since the taxes were in XXXX name and not mine I do not feel I should be responsible for the loan especially since greentree finance demands that I pay for insurance on the house yet tells me forget the house I still have to pay for the loan. the building is worth more than the loan and I told greentree that I would gladly sign the title over to them since they should have a lien to be able to collect from the new owner. XXXX in a XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. greentree has a collection notice on my credit report showing XXXX dollars do but still calls me to pay	1

some Student Account were mistakenly converted into either a Citibank Account Package in XXXX and XXXX. '' I noticed the fee and contacted Citi and was told that they are working on the problem but have no timetable for when the fee will be added back to my account.	1

some of the customer service people have been very rude	1

some ten years BEFORE Capitol One acquired XXXX XXXX and 10 years AFTER that account was closed by the court 's granting of the discharge. Capitol One 's actions of supposedly forgiving this debt and issuing a XXXX is actually a de facto attempt to reestablish a debt that was legally discharged some 17 years prior. In addition	1
some that I had already sent. Then I was told they had everything and it would be closing within days. A day or so later I got a phone call from yet another person asking for more information. At that point I made XXXX phone calls to XXXX different people telling them to Pull the Loan that I was not going to try any longer to get the loan. I also sent a Fax to another person stating the same thing. then I started getting Phone calls from several different people trying to change my mind. I asked again about returning my {$500.00} dollars and received several more calls still they were trying to move forward with the loan. One of the calls they talked to my wife and told her they would return {$250.00} dollars.Then today I received another call still trying to move forward with the loan asking me what they could do to { fix } things. when I told her that it was pulled and I was told I would get {$250.00} dollars back she said that I would not get anything back. After a lot of talk she said I would get {$130.00} back. I am so angry with everyone at Quicken Loans I just want my {$500.00} dollars back and get them out of my life .They changed their story so many times I do n't know what to believe and I do n't think they act very Professional at all .They say in their TV add that they close in 30 days on most loans and my loan was not difficult at all and we were not close to closing as they still wanted more information. Thankyou for looking into my problem	1

someone else 's name and a XXXX XXXX in another state. The car loan had been paid in full but the car was listed using my SS #. The police determined that the suspect was most likely a car dealer for which my husband and I had purchased a car from. The dealers last name was used in addition to variations of my first name ... the list of jobs associated with those illegally obtained credit reports are extremely old and were places that I had worked as a teenager ... I 'm XXXX and am a professional with a successful career and yet	1
someone higher up. The manager whose name was XXXX ( or XXXX ) got on the phone and was immediately defensive & borderline rude. She kept interrupting me & would not allow me to clarify the situation & basically was unhelpful. I never raised my voice or said anything inappropriate.

sometimes making XXXX payments a month on it. I had a checking account with a large sum of of money with them that I had to withdrawal just prior to them knocking my credit down. I had to make a wire transfer to my lawyers for the house I was purchasing. Which left the account almost empty. I find it very coincidental that they lowered my credit right after I did that.

specifically California Homeowner 's Bill of Rights ( HBOR ). Under this newly enacted law	2
specifically Portfolio Recovery does this re-reporting of the same account because new collections on a credit report causes a dramatic drop in your credit scores. I also know that this is a tactic that some collection agencies use to force customers to contact them. This new activity has been even more aggressive because this item has almost reached its date for removal from my credit fle. The problem is that this is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act	1
specifically Schedule XXXX	1
specifically Section 809. I have requested multiple times that this account be removed and as of today	1

spent XXXX+ hours trying to track my statements and make sense of what was happening. It was so complicated I gave up. I would call and speak to supervisors and be assured they would look in to it and call me within XXXX hours and never once did they return my calls. I spoke to no less than XXXX different individuals ( many of whom were supervisors ) and the problem never got resolved -- i continued to receive false charges and a confusing statement and XXXX help from the company. This problem continued month after month. I finally cancelled the card and then to add insult to injury they went back and are now charging me for the fraudulent charges in XX/XX/XXXX. They also seem to never have any record of my calls or complaints or who i spoke to. I am an attorney who is self employed and bills by the hour. This nightmare has cost me $ XXXX in lost income ... and the nightmare continues. I have never had any experience like this in my life. WORST customer service and response ever.	1
spent several hours talking to them trying to resolve this. Kept getting passed around. Now they have cancelled my insurance	1
spoke to XXXX	1

spoke with XXXX who said I would receive a credit on my card by XXXX XXXX. Nothing. I called again on XXXX and spoke with supervisor XXXX who said they could not credit my account until they get the money back from the timeshare bank. Upon further discussion	1
spoke with an agent	1
spoke with representative named XXXX who escalated additional charges since XX/XX/XXXX to her supervisor by the name of XXXX. XXXX told me the correct final bill was {$390.00} and that I would get a text message in 24-48 hours when credit was given for the remainder. I never received text message and am now being contacted by a collection agency who states we owe the full balance of over {$1200.00}. XXXX tells me there is nothing they can do even though they do have all the notations on the account from the numerous representatives I have spoken with both in the corporate store and financial services via phone. This has now resulted in effecting my credit and by no fault of my own. I have done what I have been advised to do by XXXX and their financial service team as well as followed up numerous times with no proper result.	1

I need Wells Fargo to provide me with an amortization schedule from the beginning my loan XX/XX/XXXX to present in order for the amount owed to be verified. I paid many years of double payments. Wells Fargo replied ; they lost 4 years of history but they claim the amount owed can be verified. During the foreclosure process they perjured themselves when they claimed the mortgage amount owed had been verified and have sworn to this fact. They told the courts they have all my records. How can they have verified this amount due as true if a 4 year history is not present to do so. Also during the course of this time frame many extra principle payments were made in order to pay down the mortgage sooner which need to verified as well. See attached QWR replied from Wells Fargo and recent RFI reply as well.	1

At 25.80 % for four days that is {$51.00}. At 19.99 % for four days that is {$42.00} That is a lot of Money. If they do it to me Im very sure they do it to others.	1
stating Wells Fargo was beginning foreclosure procedures. I called the Wells Fargo Dept. number on the letter from the attorney and no one at Wells Fargo could find anything associated with the property address. I involved my Wells Fargo Private Banker and met with her with all the closing paperwork and the letter from the attorney. She made a number of phone calls on my behalf. It took her being transferred to multiple people for someone to finally find a mortgage associated with this property address. Wells Fargo would not give me any information on the mortgage holder due to privacy restrictions. The mortgage is around 10 years old	1

telling us we had a credit	1
tells me he never received my paperwork. I provided the email where it was sent to him. He apologized and said I would have to prepare the paperwork AGAIN. During this conversation he begins to tell my that my house is in foreclosure which he has failed to tell me in the past when I have talked to him. US Bank sent their asset manager to my house to change the locks and make sure it is secure since I have moved out during this time. Now	1
tells me to contact first data	1
tells us that he reviewed the numbers and they are getting paid off so we DO NOT qualify for a short sale. After 1 year of ruining our credit and doing what they advise and them APPROVING us for short sale etc.. XX/XX/XXXX they advised us we do n't qualify now and they send us a letter stating if we do n't respond by XX/XX/XXXX they will move to foreclose. So they tell us XX/XX/XXXX & only give us a few days to respond and we just got the letter XX/XX/XXXX. So we have XXXX day to respond or they foreclose. After all the XXXX they put us through and they dropped the ball. We could have been negotiating with the XXXX mortgage only and not ruined our credit if they had done their job. How did they not realize this when we started? before we went past due	1

They knew this when they first started working with me regarding modifications.. now its been 6 months there is a tentative sale date on my home of 20+ years on XX/XX/XXXX.

thank you very much for the excellent service you have provided to me and for sure to many other people like me.	1
thank you!	1
thankfully no signs of it returning and grateful for that. Had to work a lot of overtime after company reorgs and downsizing after the financial meltdown economic disaster. I had to use XXXX in XXXX and XXXX for XXXX XXXX issues. Got fired in XXXX XXXX and just started fulltime employment 3 months ago which is good and I am very thankful for. But it took a while to find a job so I had to apply for state aid after unemployment ran out	1
thanks	1

that "" I 'm done ''. They will not write a mortgage for me. It 's my social	1
that 's XXXX dollars cash back .They first told me that they are going to send the cashback in check to me. I waited and waited but never received it. I called again	1
that 's a small thing to ask.	1
that 's just it sir	1
that Chase decided to close my account	1
that Chase would offer a competitive loan rate regardless of how it was obtained ( ie. online	1
that Discover NEVER reinstated it	1
that I 'm still dealing with as of today ( XX/XX/XXXX XXXX. I did	1
that I also saved. I am in no way opposed to paying this debit if it truly mine but I was not given any proof except XXXX XXXX stating that my social was attached to this card and it means nothing. There is so much fraud and stealing of individuals socials and identity theft I only want to be sure before I pay another persons debit	1
that I am a Fraud Manager at another financial institution and I am familliar with fraud security and fraud proccesses	1
that I am allowed to before age XXXX XXXX and paid off over {$150000.00} in debts. Bank of America ( BofA ) settled with me on a home that I own in XXXX XXXX	1
that I am aware of is the monthly mortgage payment ( they have no business taking $ out of my escrow account ). I asked XXXX XXXX why	1
that I am continuous latewith my mortgage payment. There by damaging my credit rating. I have not been latein making my payments. I would like them to remove the late statements.	1
that I am fighting XXXX XXXX	1
that I could by notifying them in writing or coming into the office to see her. I travel a lot and was not home the majority of the time. I returned home for the XXXX holiday and got really sick	1
that I could not get this money back. I said	1
that I could not open the account. I tried to explain that the negative balance was due to someone else using my card numer of which I had filed a claim on. However	1
that I could pay back the three month arrearage over the next few months on top of my mortgage note. Their calculation of my ability to repay XXXX mortgage notes a month was inaccurate based on the incomplete financial information they took from me over the telephone. Once in a payback plan	1
that I decided to move the money to XXXX XXXX. I contacted BOA and they said they would not do a transfer. They would either send me a check or I could get XXXX to do the transfer. At no time during this conversation	1
that I did make a purchase 3 weeks ago and just want to get my account squared away on-line so I could make my payment ... I 'm treated like a person who is evading their debt. It 's all bad enough for any customer but for someone who has been a loyal customer for 30 years ... it 's beyond the pale. The last Macy 's employee I spoke with refused to send me an electronic bill	1
that I did n't owe this debt. I sent notification in writing telling them to stop calling and stop debiting my checking account but they continued. After reconciliation I found they claimed I owed was paid off and I have proof of payment. I ended up having to close my checking account to stop them from fraudulently stealing my money. We are going to court and I hope the Judge at the very least dismisses this case and gives me a refund. They changed their name several times as well from Cavalry Collections to Cavalry SPV LLC to Cavalry SPC I LLC. The methods are less than circumspect they are vulgar	1
that I did not believe they were a collection agency but a scam. I asked them to stop calling me. They continued to call me every day for weeks. On XX/XX/XXXX15	1
that I did not believe they were a collection agency but a scam. I asked them to stop calling me. They continued to call me every day for weeks. On XXXX/XXXX/15	1
that I did not have to pay the bill	1
that I do not recall	1
that I do not reside their any longer and instructing them to cancel my policy. I have kept in contact with XXXX XXXX and told them they are not to listen to the mortgage company and today I received a check from XXXX XXXX for the refund of my policy as it was terminated at the instruction of Bank of Oklahoma. Additionally	1
that I feel were all unfair and deceptive on the part of XXXX and XXXX. Then ultimately the foreclosure happened in XXXX. However	1
that I felt some sort of a notification that my trial membership was expiring should have been provided to me	1
that I had any right what so ever to challenge the facts of the debt. I asked for him to send me a letter to verify the facts of the debt. They ended up sending me a "" summary of the payment agreement. '' I can assure you I did not agree to pay them anything	1
that I had been given terrible advice by the college. Since I graduated in 2008	1
that I had no knowledge of.	1
that I had to pay in full because I put a hold on my account. He was extremely rude	1
that I had to personally drive to the bank for assistance. I went to the bank and spoke with a banker there	1
that I have almost completed my payment in full	1
that I have also paid off	1
that I have n't given anything in 6 months and that I 'm irresponsible and that she was going to call the apartment complex I rented from that I qas evicted. Now I disclosed to my landlord that I was evicted and I rent from a place that allows to rent with evictions so I covered my XXXX. They threatened to call my parents who have no connection to the lease I signed for the apartment I got evicted from and I told them they were not to do that because they did n't sign anything and we 're not liable and could n't help me out anyway. I just got berated and talked over the whole time. They call me at least 5 to 10 times a month. I got some legal advice because apparently they are tacking on interest to my bill which when I got the letter from them finally saying what I owed it had gone from the XXXX on my eviction notice to XXXX dollars and now I 'm up to almost XXXX dollars. I do n't give them anything because I have n't received a statement of everything I have charged for the lady told me over the phone	1
that I have no responsibility for this card	1
that I have to extra processing fee in thousands by rough estimation. The better option is to recast afterward which is free in XXXX times. I took the offer.	1
that I later ( now too late ) found out did n't exists. Ironically I tried to call XXXX numerous times in the following months to get them to honor what I was offered or terminate my contract with no penalty	1
that I later found out the maximum loan amounts had been taken each semester ... even the semesters I had not spent the entire loan amount and once the recruiter resigned from his position	1
that I made the payment with the branch manager at PNC XXXX and they should get in contact with them	1
that I made to much. However	1
that I must deposit the check. I told her that my property taxes have increased and offered to fax a copy of which I did. No response from ST. I then continue to pay XXXXXXXXXXXX ( XXXX installments of {$840.00} XX/XX/XXXX & XX/XX/XXXX )	1
that I needed a HUD XXXX loan to do the improvements. Instead she put me on track for a loan where I had to make the improvements before I could close the loan. The company 's action in trying to steer me into a loan that did not meet my needs was deceptive and time consuming. It almost locked me into a loan that did no meet my needs. After I rejected the loan they were misleading me into	1
that I needed to apply for the HAMP (? not sure ) Program that was available for people like me that get behind. The home was my Marital home that I fought for when my ex husband and I split ... the plan was to make sure that I had a home to leave for my son	1
that I needed to talk to a higher up about the judgement not being lifted. By the time I spoke to a higher up	1
that I only get {$10000.00} a year approximately. I can not afford to pay them	1
that I owe an additional {$220.00} and when I called on XX/XX/XXXX	1
that I owe this entity. Additionally	1
that I recognized. One of them being a payment for {$180.00}	1
that I should be able to pay the minimum of {$25.00} per month on that {$74.00} bill. Instead she placed this on my credit report which I just noticed taking my report from 'excellent ' to 'good ' as my daughter in now looking for an apartment in XXXX and needs my credit rating to be excellent so that we can help my husband with excessive hospital and XXXX bills. I have only one large credit card bill at XXXX for {$600.00} and no other loans ( home and cars paid in cash ). I also mentioned that continual phone calls over {$74.00} are seen as invasive and that there are new laws where I can receive {$1500.00} for each additional call past my original decline phone call on XXXX XXXX	1
that I should be able to take personal calls at work	1
that I should contact the vendor about these charges. I was appalled that I was not referred to the Fraud Department and instead was told that until the charges left the Pending category and moved into Posted that I would not be able to dispute the charges. Today	1
that I want to make sure it gets the full attention of the CFPB. Bottom line	1
that I was eligible for financial aid but had missed the deadline so I could apply the following year when application opened again and they would cover most of if not the full loan. So we trusted them and jumped in. Well that was all untrue. I signed up for the financial aid immediately after I graduated and was told that was not allowed bc I had to sign up BEFORE I went to school not after ... So back to today	1
that I was filing a report with the CFPB	1
that I was no longer interested. I am reporting this for XXXX reasons : that the process was not articulated properly raising concerns that this was fraud ring	1
that I was not authorized on the account. She could not find the authorization. I asked to speak with the supervisor XXXX	1
that I was not aware of	1
that I was signed up under XXXX point offer. This is fraud	1
that I was still in process for a loan modificatioin review for my principel reduction. several months later they notified me that they updated there system and I was not in review for loan modification correction and now am behind. I spoke to several managers that were going to credit me all late fees and the months my account was in limbo waiting for them to figure it out. but instead they threatened me to bring funds in or get foreclosure. I contacted them recently about my payments	1
that I was told by another financial aid department how many private loans were taken out for me by XXXX XXXX. All of them were private loans	1
that I was turned into the credit bureau. I talked to another person on XXXX who verified	1
that I was unable to speak with any managers. They were always too busy to speak with me and I was unable to hold to speak with them. Only after spending my full morning requesting the item necessary I have finally received this item. I offered for our client to call in to assist in expediting	1
that I will receive a letter that I have to sign and return in order to do so. I never received the letter. I received a phone call today from Chase saying that my account is past due. I opened the statement I received yesterday XX/XX/2015 and there is another charge for {$100.00} against my account. Now I am waiting for a very busy medical practice to call me back which is precisely why I simply wanted their access to my account deactived until I had another appointment with them. I have never received anything from Chase for me to sign to dispute this charge in order to stop this cycle of charges according to their rules. I would think two phone calls verbally requesting this would be sufficient. XXXX XXXX only requires one phone call to settle such matters ... for them my verbal authorization is sufficient.	1
that I would acquire this fee upon any paperwork needing to be completed regarding me or my account. I recently tried to open a bank account at the local bank in my area and was denied because of this situation. On the statement the bank handed me when denied	1
that I would never under any circumstances pay the debt	1
that I would no longer be billed. When my bill arrived in XXXX XXXX	1
that I would not pay anymore money.	1
that I would still be able to obtain loan provided Exeter reported correctly and only reported a repossession to the credit bureaus. Exeter has wrongfully reported that I was late in paying on my account	1
that OCWEN did not initially disclose and collect. This is going to cause another financial hardship. My payments will go from roughly {$2600.00} to roughly {$3800.00} per month for the next year	1
that Payday loans are illegal in Massachusetts. I 'm battling XXXX and need to be sure I can protect my children. Please help us.	1
that US Bank wants to help me keep my house	1
that XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
that XXXX XXXX XXXX was sold or closed by XXXX then went to another company then deleted by EOS. It seems they keep extending the original date of last activity. It went from XXXX to XXXX to XXXX account opening. Please let them know that they threatening and falsy promising me in writing one thing then re-reporing the account with different account numbers. Also the latest letter came with XXXX letterhead but saying that some US Asset Management XXXX is their client now. Also XXXX stopped completely collecting in XXXX. And they need to stick to their agreement or I would have to file a lawsuit. And I am also a XXXX veterans wife who receives XXXX and I a XXXX XXXX survivor.. They go by my old name ( XXXX )	1
that XXXX accounts are deemed frivilous due to their classification as already investigated is false. See Attached. In any event	1
that XXXX is charging me restocking fee. I have faxed PayPal dispute form with proofs of email correspondence with XXXX. I have explain PayPal that my emails states charge for assembly of elliptical and PayPal have this charge as restocking fee. This completely contradicts this charge. PayPal answer is '' There is nothing we can do '' You are responsible for the restocking fee. I spoke to a few supervisors XXXX XXXX	1
that a Notice of Default has been recorded against my property	1
that a claim had been filed against him and his old address was no good. Informed XXXX XXXX that we did not know where our son was and to not call us any more. On approximately XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX called again. We informed him of previous request not to call	1
that a manager was not available. She had then told me she would not except a partial payment either. Then proceeded to tell me per my finances there is no reason I should be making partial payments. I then again asked to speak to a supervisor	1
that a separate interest was attached to the amount owed for every day after the actual due date of the loan - meaning that I am being charged an additional fee even when I pay within the grace period. I have been making payments on this loan for roughly ten years	1
that after checking with the XXXX	1
that all changed just as it did many Americans on Monday	1
that also was never received. I called numerous times to try to get it emailed. I was finally advised to just wait on it. : - XXXX On XXXX	1
that amount we were able to pay it	1
that amount would be approximately {$36.00} per month.	1
that are never kept current even at the end of a billing period. Additionally	1
that arrangement was not accorded when I first took the mortgage. What are my options? Is that even legal?	1
that banks apply the interbank rate they deem appropriate to make money. However	1
that before they transfered me	1
that borrower does not qualify for the HAFA relocation incentive "" because they did not qualify for HAMP '' So ... .... If someone does not qualify for a loan mod they are ineligible for a relocation incentive????	1
that contacted me to discuss settlement of the account without properly identifying themselves as a debt collector. XXXX XXXX XXXX contacted me on XXXX XXXX	1
that debt is from XXXX which was I 've never used that services all my life. Please help. I 'm afraid if I do n't do anything they will kept on sending me a bill plus fee which was not belong to me at all.	1
that different reps are able to give different rules. Now I am being told that there 's no way to get rid of all interest or there can be no deletion.	1
that does n't make a lot of sense to me. However	1
that due diligence and risk management makes Wells Fargo libel and accountable for the merchants they keep and third-party payment processors. and during my dispute I was not given a chargeback there for facilitating these merchants and third-party payment processors. When I asked the supervisor to refund the money that was taken he said no and that I 'm not his customer and that my credit card companies ripped me off. ( See XXXX ) also disputed charges with a company called the XXXX design	1
that further phone calls would be considered harassment. The first caller would never admit that they would stop. He also never gave a definite yes on a recorded line that they would cease phone communication. They dance around the legality and will hang up. These Portfolio Recovery people are XXXX. Preying on almost a XXXX year old debt that does n't affect a credit. I 've googled them and seen that they will not stop harassing people	1
that gave them the right to "" decide '' for me? I have used Paypal for a plethora of purchases as well as a few recurring payment situations. However	1
that had gone into collection. The problem is I as well as my family have never owned a XXXX phone	1
that has a bill for {$500.00}. They leave no voicemail	1
that has never been a problem. I skipped the XXXX 2015 payment	1
that has proven to be a challenge for me. I have been appliying for mortgage relief with Nationstar for years now. I have income to prove	1
that he will send out a representative to see me to help. But toward the end of the conversation	1
that he would administrate my finances. He insinuated his way into my business	1
that i did not did such of transaction that i did not have my card on my posession	1
that i have on my checking account	1
that i may have been a victim of predatory lending and that if i did not sign any documentation for an A.R.M.	1
that i took this loan	2
that if it did not close by the date	1
that if we reduced our loan request to 75 % of the Fair Market Value - as supported by their appraisal - there would be {$0.00} closing cost	1
that in XX/XX/XXXX they closed all of their offices except the main office	1
that in any case XXXX XXXX was confusing the location geographically. XXXX XXXX submitted the money-wire transfer forms and while I was sitting in his office he received a telephone call from someone who then told him to ask me as to the nature of the money wire. At this juncture XXXX XXXX began to repeat to me questions from the unknown person on the other end of the telephone. I never talked to this person directly nor was I given the persons name or identifying information. I told the person	1
that in order to start the re-payment plan I would have to pay the current month mortgage payment to him in the form of an automatic payment from my checking account in the amount {$2200.00} ( informed that there was an increase in escrow ) and XXXX monthly payments of {$370.00} added to my monthly mortgage. I agreed to let him debit my checking account for {$2200.00} and in XX/XX/XXXX I sent Nationstar a check in the amount of {$2500.00}. During the month of XXXX I was inundated with telephone calls and debt collection letters from Nationstar	1
that is a XXXX % difference in my income. I think any reasonable person would consider a XXXX % increase in their monthly income to be substantial. There is no justifiable reason for the denial	1
that is all they have. Afni	1
that is all. Other than this I have made extra payments in XX/XX/2014 for XXXX and XXXX payments of {$250.00} in XX/XX/2014 which were never applied to the principal. I have requested several times for a summary of all payments made by me from XX/XX/2013 to XX/XX/2014 and never received this. What kind of a mortgage company is Penny Mac hoarding the money of a poor homeowner who was never late in making payments	1
that is in clear violation of my credit card agreement	2
that is not an option ''	1
that is not my ultimate concern. My privacy has been violated by Discover cards and their employees because I received multiple calls from my mother ( who does not live with me	1
that is not the case.In XXXX 2015	1
that is not the crux of the matter. I am questioning WHY Chase continually approved charges over my credit limit. At about this time	1
that is when we found out that the value of our home is still under water by about {$18000.00}. She advised us to file for a short sale	1
that is why they only have my name and office number and address only. I work hard to keep my business up on XXXX search results. I informed Transworld Systems that the address listed under the debtor information was not mine	1
that is {$240.00} more than the original amount FOR A MEDICAL BILL	1
that it 's the posting date that counts.	1
that it dawned on me that they were attempting to link XXXX of our accounts - purely as a punitive action against her for her apparent default on her own separate account.	1
that it exceeded the 80 % max limit. I asked Ocwen to return my XXXX payments. The rep said it would take XXXX business days. I called Ocwen back on XXXX XXXX when my funds had not been returned to my bank account. I gave them my account number and routing number to my bank	1
that it is their job to basically hunt me down	1
that it only needed to be set up that way initially. They said I could just discontinue the transfer at any time and no fees would result. So I discontinued the recurring transfer in XX/XX/XXXX. Since that savings account usually does not have much money in it ( I do most of my banking at another institution )	1
that it was n't me or authorized by me. I went to the XXXX XXXX store that the purchase was made after ending the phone call with your claims representative. I told the manager the same thing and he assured me that he was going to send the request to corporate to get the footage of the purchase. I returned to the store in XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and was told to speak to another manager and this manager was the person who allowed someone to make a purchase on my account without my card. I do not know if he is still employed but I assume that he is because this matter did n't seem important to the head management at this store.	1
that it was not delinquent until XXXX and I would be making the payment prior to that date. We had a considerable discussion during which I informed the gentleman that I was self-employed and my cash flow was such that I could not promise payment on any certain date	1
that it would be 48 hours before they could call back meaning Monday. XXXX then said they never even received a request for the final draw. I asked why they sent those forms and requests and he did n't seem to have an answer. He said he could resend the request but without the bill the file is not complete and the request would be denied.	1
that it would be a reputable company. Clearly not. Can anyone stop them from deceiving others?	1
that it would be corrected. I 've disputed several times to credit report agency with not results. I do not owe this and the management company never answers my calls or requests. The owners of the unit ( investors ) XXXX XXXX XXXX will not respond either. I will say this	1
that made me believe that he is a government. He notified me that I was offered to get XXXX dollars due to I am on the way become XXXX and I had clean background	1
that makes the grocery purchases not eligible for the American Express 6 % credit. I explained to them that our local grocery store at XXXX does not have a gas station. They responded that since some of the XXXX XXXX stores do have gas stations that that is how they code all XXXX XXXX stores. I complained that certainly this was n't fair but they refused to change our account to get the full 6 % rebate. Appreciate you help on this unfair matter. Thank you XXXX and XXXX XXXX	1
that mean 's there 's nothing left owed. You should not be surprised with a {$5.00} or {$2.00} fee after the balance was 'paid in full ' and have your credit destroyed. The most I have ever charged on the card was {$240.00} and I always paid the balances in full within 45 days. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I called Macy 's and verified that my balance is truly XXXX	1
that month was rolled into the new loan modification. I was told to make the next payment in XX/XX/XXXX	1
that my account was opened on XXXX/XXXX/15 and not new. They told me to call the local branch. I called the local branch and spoke with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who said although the person who helped me open the account new about the upcoming promotion	1
that my brother is going to give them the key for the house and they said	1
that my flood insurance policy has expired. The policy has expired because my mortgage company OCWEN mortgage has not paid the policy out of escrow ( as they 've been directed to do and as they 've done in the past ). In talking with XXXX	1
that my home was sold at auction due to failure to pay property taxes ; by which they had law enforceme to serve me with a fraudulent eviction notice in XXXX of XXXX that stated I had 45 days to vacate the premises.	1
that my husband would be facing legal fines. He did not leave a company name and he did not give the mini-miranda about trying to collect a debt. He did leave a case number and docket number. He also left the phone number of the company he is working for. Of course now I 'm freaking out because I 'm worried that the police are going to come to my house and take my husband in front of our kids ( he would actually be at work during the time of this scheduled visit ).	1
that my property taxes had n't been paid in the prior six months. Nationstar	1
that my son and I share the same name	1
that my student checking account would be AUTOMATICALLY AND WITHOUT NOTICE changed into a Personal Checking account with a XXXX monthly maintenance fee. Had they informed me	1
that negative reporting information would be removed from my credit reports. They cleared up a portion	1
that no one lives here by that name. Yet	1
that on XXXX XXXX	1
that on the back on page XXXX	1
that one of our merchant 's systems had been compromised and they may be collecting sensitive account information	1
that payment was placed on a 7 to 8 day hold. I made another payment on XXXX XXXX for another {$800.00} plus and that payment is now on hold for XXXX to 8 days.	1
that provided Wells Fargo XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Trustee said	2
that punishes customers who are in the midst of financial difficulties. Attached is a copy of the disclosure notice with the description of the fee circled.	1
that relates to the matter ; XXXX XXXX Proof of valid assignment of the alleged debt to me ; XXXX XXXX Complete payment history & books and account records going back to the original creditor ; andXXXX ) Notice	1
that requires the lender to not only conduct a public auction	1
that said debt had no activity since XXXX	1
that same day. Both offices have stated that they do not accept checks	1
that seems weird. The cards were activated and the individual immediately proceeded to make purchases. From XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX	1
that she had heard nothing of it. She seemed obviously surprised. With that	1
that since we dont qualify for the modification we dont qualify for deferred payments. We have gotten repeated calls	1
that someone charged on my debit card	1
that supports they can pay this! .Each and every time the various representatives - XXXX	1
that the Claims Department was going to close the account without explanation and I would be getting a letter as such. I have never received the letter and the account is now restricted but not yet closed based on the information the Claims Department gave me on the phone.	1
that the account had been 'flagged ' and would be closed. No reason was given. Multiple inquiries	1
that the annual policy was {$2300.00}	1
that the club only offers auto-pay as the only option	1
that the court has the wrong address on file for me ; 4. after 15 years with a judgement	1
that the derogatory comment would Not	1
that the loan was late in XXXX XXXX and a decision was made to "" charge off '' the loan at that time. WE DISPUTE THIS. This was NEVER communicated to us by XXXX or Chase. We had to contact them to ask about the uncashed check. They now refuse to put in writing the cause of the charge off or any results of their investigation. As a result of their investigation	1
that the mortgage was in Foreclosure and that I would need to request a reinstatement -- of which would include a reinstatement fee. I was told that the Reinstatement Notification would be sent within XXXX hours. I received the Reinstatement Notification 4 days later.	1
that the pending amount due would be reported. I was only told that once I made these XXXX payments	1
that the transaction has been cancelled ''. So today	1
that their database and securities systems lacked the most basic protections - Scottrade Financial Services ignored these tips and as a result over XXXX customers has their most sensative personal information exposed in a very preventable cyber attack.	1
that their systems were down ( Hard to believe ) and that I would get a call back from a manager ( I have n't ). All I want is for them to not treat me differently because I am physically incapable of getting a driver 's license.	1
that there was NO social security number captured from that person for the account AND when reporting the credit situation	3
that these additional funds would be applied towards the promotional balance.	1
that they are bullying me into voluntarily closing the account as they are not able to make a significant profit off of my credit card account as the operations cost are somewhat equal to the revenue they generate from my account. With ten years experience working in the credit card industry for several of the world 's largest credit card issuers the general rule of thumb is that customers are eligible for a courtesy late fee waver once every 12 months for an open account in good standing. They failed to adhere to the rule of thumb in this case. With these unfair practices I find it hard to see how Discover has a reputation for delivering superior customer service with ratings just behind XXXX XXXX. I do n't intend to sit back and let discover bully me as a consumer.	1
that they are deliberately reporting false information to the credit agencies in order to prevent me from refinancing	1
that they are not required to review me again for an assistance request. When clarification was asked for not reviewing me again for assistance	1
that they are obtaining from a source other than the duly elected XXXX Collector. I would like them to be compelled to furnish me this information that I am paying for.	1
that they are unable to assist. I do not want to lose my home because BMO claims to have made payments that have not been made.	1
that they had contacted XXXX of my previous employers inquiring about my work status. I called them back and they tried to tell me that my father had answered all of the "" security questions '' right	1
that they had no contract that they could produce but that I must have signed one and their contracts auto-renew for 5 years. I contacted an attorney who told me this was fraud but when I confronted the representative from the company	1
that they had to cancel our very affordable modification and raise it to {$1600.00} almost {$500.00} more than what we had expected to be our new mortgage payment and the turning point in our financial merry-go-round.	1
that they have received my complaint and need more time to research my issue.	1
that they have turned over my mortgage to another company. Is that even legal	1
that they lost it	1
that they needed some additional personal information to unlock it. I answered their questions and they say they would process accordingly. A week later	1
that they never actually put us on. We owe {$1700.00} on our Lowes card. After the egregious "" service '' charges	1
that they put my life in danger. He tried to argue. I told him that my lawyer will be subpoenaing the records. He said get your lawyer and hung up. I called CFPB and the representative told me a few things to protect me against scams. I called back later without giving the representative any information and asked for their license number. At first	1
that they sent out a letter requesting this information and received no response	1
that they should not have been reporting to the credit bureau until after the bankruptcy was discharged.	1
that they took did an emergency deferment. Then	1
that they were not able to further process my complaint and pretty much told me i was on my own. Mind you that I have never been signed up for any automatic bill pay or anything with XXXX. I would gladly pay my bill as I have excellent credit but on my own terms and with the payment method of my choice.	1
that they will mail me a check. I fulfilled the requirements for the promotion on XXXX XXXX	1
that they would not see a dime from me. I had a balance of about $ XXXX and I believe the balance is now up to XXXX or XXXX ( with all the late fees and other fees ). I have a credit score of XXXX and I applied for a VA home loan and was turned down because of the collection that is still on my credit report. The VA finance recommended that I get in contact with your company and maybe you could help me.	1
that this debt is invalid and XXXX should be fined for these practices. Midland Funding and XXXX claim they have been sending me bills to an address I have not occupied since 2006. I signed off on no new finance charges etc as they claim.	1
that this information on my credit is available on CREDIT TRACKER '' which is being offered by CAPONE.. she then say their decision is proprietary..	1
that this is something that was known the whole time that I would never have been able to get a loan through them and was just strung along through the whole process	1
that this type of loan would not be eligible for any time of extended repayment plan. I thought by choosing a loan where I paid a small monthly payment while I was in school	1
that this was a policy of Wells Fargo and that it would apply to me once the funds were removed.	1
that this was an organization I had not been apart of it since XXXX	1
that those were my problems not his.	1
that throughout this process I got further behind because at XXXX point I was presented with a monthly bill for approximately {$400.00} when I typically paid {$120.00} for XXXX services. From XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX I attempted to get my billing corrected. Meanwhile I was paying late because there where wrong charges on mybil and I was unable to pay them. Finally	1
that time I hung up the phone in anger. Well today I received a letter of collection dated XXXX XXXX	1
that took over my non-federal loans. I was making monthly money order payments to the collection agencies for over two years	2
that transaction left me with {$55.00} in my account. This is not the first time Bank of America has charged me an overdraft fee when the only charge that put me below a {$0.00} balance was the actual overdraft fee. This is	1
that upon my setting up Elan Autopay originally on XXXX XXXX	1
that was 60 days ago	1
that was a different bank. I have now been informed from Regions that I will not be reimbursed for the $ XXXX+ that was forged on this account	1
that was acquired by them in XXXX of 2008. XXXX XXXX XXXX ca n't provide the information on the XXXX electronic transfer of funds	1
that was filed in bankruptcy .We were discharged XXXX/XXXX/2013. this means they have been paid but wo n't take it off. The amount filed in bankruptcy was XXXX.I am not sure if you can help but maybe if you ca n't you can direct me to the right source.	1
that was in XXXX last year still has n't been fixed	1
that was my dad	1
that was n't even part of my browser window without scrolling. I called the company to dispute the claim. It took me awhile to unsubscribe and they refused to refund my money since I had used the service ( I had to log in to find a phone number to call ) and had been made aware of the service on the XXXX screen of the process. Very shady and I want to say fraudulent practice	1
that was never delivered. But the dispute was closed without giving me credit for {$490.00}	1
that was never factored into the original garnishment to satisfy a XXXX credit card. I provided proof from my work payroll department that all of the debt had been paid in full from the original garnishment collected from XXXX thru XXXX. They insisted that an interest of $ XXXX still due. In XXXX I received another notice that interest accumulating from XXXX/XXXX/15 would be applied to the account. I want this to desist and Kirschenbaum XXXX.	1
that was never produced until the very last minute	1
that was never sent. The representatives become rude when I get upset and it seems that they no longer want to help me. They just tell me to pay my bill	1
that was not the XXXX guidelines. I am paying them 7.25 % interest on the loan. I think they just want to keep getting the higher interest. Can you help? Can you clarify "" personal '' funds for the purpose or removing XXXX person 's name from the loan when refinancing?	1
that was not the case. Rushmore failed to acquire all the proper documentations from XXXX which would show that the property is insured	1
that was opened in XXXX	3
that was paid. I contact Corporate XXXX Banner Finance and spoke to Secretary XXXX. I ask why was a inquiry done on my behalf	1
that was us plan. They are seeing very week about some short sale. In my option is unlawful and XXXX government should take their license away.. They are using some "" dude '' from XXXX that have no idea about our law and country. Please help. We have there kids	1
that we have made monthly payments on since XX/XX/XXXX	1
that were not being addressed. When we left the property we returned the keys. We had been given an estimate of what we would have to pay back because we were terminating our lease. It was n't even close to the amount of what is on me and my wife 's credit report. We were blind sided and never contacted except from a credit bureau with an amount not explained	1
that wo n't HAPPEN on my XXXX WATCH! Now they 've tried and it 's not been successful	1
that would be the correct tactic. To no avail	1
that would n't pertain any type of payment information to set up	1
that would need to be claimed under my homeowners policy.	1
that would not be true? They switch me to a person in "" security '' and as I question and challenge the truth about the switch	1
that would square things. I closed the account and sent them the money. Now	1
that you did not use reasonable measures to insure the accuracy of my credit reports and now you are stalling the process further. I am irritated at your indictment and I have consulted with the court my rights in regards to my credit file. I look forward to your expediting my original request immediately. When someone is the victim of identity theft	1
thats it!! And my XXXX is XXXX monthly. I 've paid them {$620.00} for the appraisal and also paid XXXX homes {$1000.00} for a deposit. I knew before even applying that they could use just my XXXX income	1
thatthese funds were supposed to be applied to interest and principalbalance first. I requested that the suspense funds be applied in thisprescribed manner. However	1
the "" Deferred Principal '' was to be prorated on the basis of the time the loan has elasped compared to the loan maturity. Chase used a fine print -- half hidden from the eye	1
the "" collection agency '' would not identify who it was. XXXX account had been placed with a collection agency	1
the "" extra '' trial payment that I paid to Suntrust in XXXX was "" missing '' and was just found & sent to XXXX two days ago. I contacted XXXX on XXXX XXXX and they said that they had not yet received anything from Suntrust regarding the loan modification so they asked me to send them copies of all of the modification paperwork to them to speed up the process. I have emailed it to them three times	1
the "" servicer '' filed a claim against my home in a bankruptcy proceeding although I 'd never missed a payment. I filed the BK XXXX for other reasons. The "" servicer '' has still not complied with my request	1
the "" stop '' can only be executed for 6 months at a time and then must be renewed. Since my Line of Credit expires in 2019	1
the $ amount of the purported claim appears to change	1
the 1st representative agreed to credit it back to my account. Then I was transferred to another representative who told me that I owe money for bank ruptcy. I do not owe any money for bankruptcy and they have never billed me for any legal fees owed. The problem is whenever I have paid extra money on my mortgage	1
the 7-year rule applies pertaining to the posting of credit histories. All Ocwen loans must be deleted permanently	1
the ACH amount was credited back to my account and a {$34.00} NSF fee levied. I did not see this charge until the next day	1
the ATM ate my check at my bank and I am sure I am on camera making this transaction. I want my money.	1
the Act of 2009	1
the American Dream Loan is not for low-income buyers. In my opinion and experience with the process	1
the Bank had sent to them. They could not tell me when that would occur but that I should "" keep in mind '' not to spend the money or the account might go into an overdraft situation. What kind of trickery is this? Showing a bill as 'paid ' and yet not debiting the account until some future	1
the Bank purposefully burdened the application process with requests for documentation that were not timely in relationship to my expected closing and were unreasonable in number and in the nature of the information being sought.	1
the Bank writes that my CLOSED account was overdrawn on XX/XX/XXXX. Because the malicious and fraudulent action by the Bank to make my CLOSED account overdrawn LONG AFTER it was closed	1
the Branch Manager provided false information pertaining to my account and about when I closed my account. I will upload their response	1

She referred me to their accounts recovery number. I called the number she gave me and was told that the recovery department only took payments and that she could not look into my account. She told me that I should go to the bank where I closed my account and speak with them.I went to the branch today and spoke with one of the bankers there. I explained the situation	1

the Chase Customer Service representative I spoke with advised me that the check should have arrived within a few days of issue due to the proximity between their check printing office in the XXXX and XXXX.

the FDCPA and in Contempt of Court Orders. I was led into default by misrepresentation in XXXX prior foreclosures and unlawful overcharging hindered my ability to make payments. The FTC action against Countrywide found this a violation of 15 U.S.C. 45a and the loan contract. They induced me to enter the modification program instead of pursuing affordable loan terms by other means while concealing the lack of authority to modify. My attempt to make payments was prevented by the bank 's agent who instructed me not to do so excusing my performance pursuant to CC XXXX ( The want of performance of an obligation is excused when such performance is prevented or delayed by the act of the creditor ). Refusing or hindering payments was a failure of an implied condition precedent of the DOT requiring payments. Foreclosure was initiated without first considering my loan for modification as required by the Countrywide Judgment and was in CONTEMPT of Court which within the US District Court is a denial of my Due Process of Liberty "" to establish a home '' and will cause me "" irreparable injury ''. Foreclosure was initiated without a Notice of Acceleration and in the absence of default as thousands of dollars of illegal overcharging had not been refunded. While the DOT provides that no offset owed by the lender relieves the borrower from monthly payments there is no conclusive presumption that this applies to illegal over-charging that is withheld which is prohibited by the DOT. The mortgagee filed forged documents in the Recorders Office violating Penal Code 115 clouding my title. The DOT was violated when the entity purporting the right to invoke the power of sale was not the lender of record and had no legal interest in the loan. In an attempt to amend the defect a back-dated	1

I finally called Carrington regarding the payment not being pulled & was informed that I need to re-apply for this service and that because I was behind on the mortgage they would not consider me until I was caught up. When I inquired about being behind they told me that because they had yet to receive the XXXX XXXX payment I was now overdue ( XXXX pulled this payment on XXXX XXXX and Carrington took over loan on XXXX XXXX ).

the above the law financial industry. Which is the subject of my complaint. If the Credit reporting agency reconciliates the record	1
the account can not be found under my phone number ( but they still keep calling )	1
the account does n't just completely disappear. Eos said they would send me a fraud kit to fill out but it just does n't seem legitimate. They also said they already reported me to the credit bureau which seemed more like they wanted me to go ahead and give them my credit card number over the phone.	1
the account had a balance of {$190.00} in which I made a payment of {$200.00}. This a.m. I went into the branch to try to get an update statement showing the {$200.00} payment with a available credit of {$500.00}. Unfortunately	2

the account representative asked about XXXX XXXX being possibly entered as a beneficiary and account holder agreed to accept this option. However	1
the account should be removed from my credit report. The CFPB has my formal permission to access my credit reports for the sake of this account.	1
the account still remains there. I have advised the bureaus that the reporting dates are incorrect	2

the amount was {$300.00} and we did not received the final bill because of our move to XXXX on XX/XX/2013.	1
the amount would be {$34000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/15 IL. Hardest Hit program sent me a email to inform me that! I was in shock	1
the announced payments on the settlement statements varied considerably between what they said I would pay vs what I have been billed	1
the answer was vague. Subsequently	1

the application must be considered facially complete.	1
the appraisal had been ordered over ten days prior and our credit card already charged. The appraiser did not go out to our new property until Monday XXXX XXXX. Later that day the broker emailed us a list of new conditions required to close. Example	1
the appraisal only came in at {$4000.00} more than what we had to have for the XXXX and XXXX with little room for cash out. Oddly though	1
the appraisal was inflated by {$47000.00} in only a span of 9 months. We feel this is predatory as Citi signed off on the appraisal which was done by the same appraiser who appraised our home for the previous loan. We have attached the appraisals for your review.	1
the appraised value has increased to over {$430000.00} and they will not be considering the current offer of {$330000.00}. They have no explanation as to the differing values and will not even discuss this any further. No one will speak with us and the assigned representative does not respond tocalls or emails as we have been trying to reach him since the offer was submitted on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In addition to this	1

the balance in the account that changes throughout the day. I had several other items pending that cleared causing overdrafts because of the way they manipulate their processing. I paid XXXX overdrafts for overdrawing my account {$42.00} with XXXX transaction. The total in fees for this XXXX overdrawn transcation is {$320.00}. Suntrust 's practices directly conflict with FDIC guidance	1
the balance left from that was taken for interest charges	1
the balance remained but they did not bill me. Later	1
the balance should be {$470.00} because the interest rate charged by Argon Credit is in violation -- balance due {$2000.00}	1
the balance subject to the higher rate should have been {$220.00}. I contacted Bank of America to resolve and they claim they applied the amount towards the lowest APR in accordance with Federal Law. This is NOT what the law prescribes. That only applies to the minimum payment amount and any amount above that must be applied towards the highest balance.	1
the bank 's witness testified that the Bank never considered or evaluated Defendants ' application for Modification	1
the bank again refused to move the money to my mother and to close the account. The entire time the balance of the account was depleted through bank fees from around {$1800.00} to around {$1000.00}. In the end	1

the bank cancelled the associated credit card and precluded any further credit charges. The loan was converted from a credit line into a mortgage as far as usage and loan servicing is concerned. So far	1
the bank charged me another {$38.00}. When I called customer service on XXXX	1

the bank had mixed someone else 's information with my name on the account and it would be difficult to straighten it out without my mother. In the interim we went and had power of attorney documents notarized for me. However when I went to the bank	1
the bank has attempted to forecast my escrow account for the 5th year of my mortgage. Technically	1
the bank has charged us for insurance. We sent the required info to show we are not in a flood zone. This was verified in writing by a certified letter by XXXX XXXX and our insurance company.All this was FAXed to the bank per their request. Thru many phone calls	1
the bank is not willing to give us the chance to recover from our loss of income and take advantage of any available program to keep us back on track and keep our home.	1
the bank is obligated to issue a discharge and state law in Massachusetts requires them to do so within 45 days.	1
the bank owes me all that interest money in years of holding onto my payments.	1
the bank penalized me by closure of my accounts.	1
the bank rejected XXXX attempts	1

the bank took the XXXX transaction XXXX	1
the bank was extremely busy	1
the bank was holding our money without our consent. Previously the bank has taken our XXXX funds	1
the bank who I represented agreed to do repairs to the roof for financing purposes. The finance broker agreed to pay for the buyer repairs. He the broker said he would build it into the loan. I verbally said	1
the banker has assured me that there will be no charges	1
the banker withdrew {$480.00} from my checking account but told me it would be part of the closing costs. On Friday afternoon	1
the banking center said the person in charge was n't available. I got a letter from BOA where it stated there was NO transaction on XXXX XXXX for the amount of {$240.00}. I have supporting papers of payment	1
the bankruptcy attorney contacted me again stating that Ocwen had filed the claim	1
the banks applicable policies on someone who is NOT a customer is an act of ultra vires at best. PERIOD. Such as a Drivers License	1
the banks are prohibited from "" pursuing debt collection and enforcement activities after such forms are issued ''. The issuance of the XXXX creates a XXXX balance with the banks for me. And	1
the beneficiary for those fund name is XXXX XXXX	1
the best they seem able to do is reduce my payment to just under {$1000.00}.	1
the bill does not even give a break down of what was done	1
the bill was retracted and adjusted. The health facility took full responsibility for their error and retracted the bill	1
the billing collection agency refused providing the information claiming they did not have to provide it. I asserted that per FCRA	1
the bills were still being returned. I asked the woman how long it had been until they had the right address	1
the borrower 's loan does not need to be currently serviced by XXXX	1
the borrower and Seterus entered into a permanent loan modification under the XXXX Standard Loan Modification program. After the borrower 's loan had been permanently modified	1
the borrowers attempted to surrender the property	1
the borrowers had their own insurance at the same time. The only documents they have from this era are attached along with the forced placed insurance. The total cost of escrow in the Final Judgment of Foreclosure totals nearly {$200000.00}. This is hazard insurance XXXX {$81000.00}	1
the borrows were told by XXXX XXXX if Guild Mortgage Company	1
the branch manager informed us that the bank had misplaced our signature cards and they required a new one in order to keep our account in good standing. In reviewing our account	1
the branch manager told me they would make sure that any outstanding debits would be paid. This has not happened. Not only was I not properly notified	1
the breakdown on how XXXX insurance came up with that amount and the amount that was paid from my insurance. Okay this how it all got started. I went to Tennessee where the accident occurred and got the police report because I had all the other documents already to go. I put the documents in the mail the same day. I mailed the information XXXX. When I mailed it off I made sure that the company gets it in a couple of days. Okay I thought the process had begun until I check my credit report and I showed thirty day delinquent. So I called XXXX and asked them why have n't XXXX Toyota received the remaining balance yet from the 2015 XXXX XXXX. They stated that all the information has not been received to get the ball rolling. So I asked what other information that you are talking about. XXXX stated we are still waiting on the police report. I told them I sent it out already. We went back and forth with the same conversation. I told them I paid XXXX dollars for that incident report. I am glad I made a copy of the XXXX I had. So I sent another report out to them. I kept checking every week to see had the process begin. Still no word on when they will pay the remaining balance. So I asked do I need to pay my regular car payment so it will not go on my credit. The worker stated your case is being processed just waiting on the incident report. By that time another thirty days was approaching on my credit report. I just sit there with tears in my eyes because I knew it was nothing I could do because one thirty days had already smashed my good standing credit. I have worked so hard trying to do the right thing with my credit just for this company to give me the run around on finishing paying for the car. When you add extra coverage on your vehicle to make sure it is paid in full just in case something happen	1
the burden of proof is not on ME. I am not claiming fraud nor identity theft. And I can not prove I paid a debt I do even know exists or is mine.	1

the buyer just needed a little time to correct their credit so this would give them control of the property. They told me that I may still need to sign papers for the bank when everything had finalized. Initially after the closing	1
the buyers accepted the bank's offer of $XXXX. The sale was later denied by Bank of America for yet unexplained reasons. I have been reaching out to them since XX/XX/XXXX with no luck. I have been trying to sell this house for 3 years with many people looking but not wanting to buy. It is very frustrating that I finally found some serious buyers and the bank is making them lose interest by denying this sale and not providing any reason. I am getting to the point where I won't be able to afford the mortgage payments any longer and it is unfortunate that I have made every payment since I bought the house in XX/XX/XXXX	1
the buyers financing fell apart	1
the calls not only have kept coming but have increased in frequency and have even started coming in the middle of the night. I have never been a Citibank customer and I do not know anyone with the name of the person they say they are trying to reach. I really would like to see these calls stopped.	1

the card had expired. Citi refuses access to the funds or send me a new card because they say the card has expired. I do not think that is right or fair. I would be ok if they charge a monthly inactivity fee but at least return the remaining funds to a hard working individual consumer who lives from paycheck to paycheck. Thank you.	1
the card was locked by my father	1
the cashiers check had my name and mortgage account number in the memo section so they would know which mortgage account to credit. I confirmed that the check was deposited to the Green tree bank account ( # XXXX ) I checked a few weeks later since I had n't gotten any loan pay off papers. Green Tree said they had gotten nothing. I obtained a copy ( front and back ) of the cashed Cashiers check and sent it to them. They looked at this and admit it looks like they got the money	1
the charge went through and BoA without any warning or email to allow me to transfer funds stamped a {$35.00} charge on my account.	1

I was really starting to feel nervous so when he came back I said is it ok? He said that USAA would not let the loan go through and that it had been reviewed and for some reason it had something to do with my personal information. I was floored with shock. USAA was so vague they said that had to review everything and it would take 3 to 5 days. I asked for a supervisor and everyone was treating my like a criminal. No one told me why	1

Apparently XXXX and XXXX XXXX did not verify the 7-year end-date to the XXXX late fee transaction posted ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) in the records of the original creditor for this debt - Wells Fargo Bank.	1
the errors have not only not been corrected	1
the escrow should have been a {$0.00} balance as I made a payment of {$130.00} to the escrow account and {$400.00} to my principal/interest ( my normal mortgage payment pre-escrow ). I included a signed letter with the payment breakdown and requesting a phone call if there were any issues. I followed up with a phone call to ensure that my instructions were followed through. This was not the case. This is an arrangement that was entered into after my last complaint against GreenTree Servicing. My account has since been transferred to Ditech Servicing due to a merger.	1

the fee was assessed because funds were insufficient on the day before ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ). I expressed to these representatives that	1

the fees could only be 3 %	1
the fees taken away and my credit repaired as I have been paying high Intrest rates on car loans and such because of a poor credit score. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	1
the fees were credited and I assumed that their agreement to cancel the fees meant a full resolution had been reached. However	1
the file goes stale and then the homeowner has to provide all the same documents they have already provided on a timely basis. Then it takes another month for the bank to review them and then lo and behold	1
the file has yet to be deemed a complete file. Nationstar appears to be reviewing single documents or single pages of documents instead of an entire file. I have persistently asked that this file be considered 'complete ' for a short sale. I have submitted files and documents for months! Time to make this a complete file.	1
the file is not open	1
the file was never updated. I would have to explain my situation over and over again.

the house is scheduled to foreclose in one week on XXXX XXXX and am not sure what to do. It 's egregious to leave me with no option but to foreclose	1
the house was livable	1
the improper and illegal collection practices they used. In addition	1
the individual who had called told him that I owed a balance and the amount of said balance. I initially had issues with them calling my phone before XXXX when I was in XXXX over the XX/XX/XXXX	1
the information provided clearly states Revoked but Equifax refuses to report it as such and nobody in their office seems to know what to do. Their incompetence is costing me closing on a home. I called many times but only spoke with supervisors on XXXX occasions	1

the judge granted both the land and home to me. This divorce was granted through notice of publication since the whereabouts of my spouse were unknown.	1
the judgment was for XXXX	1
the judicial system	1
the lady I talked to said that the money was credited back to the credit card account. I told her that was totally wrong. How can Bank of America take {$520.00} out of my checking account to credit the credit card account ... then removed that {$520.00} and again credit it to the credit card account. Totally makes no sense whatsoever. Bank of America states they will research the problem which will take at least seven to ten business days. This is unacceptable.	1
the lady got extremely rude with me and very argumentative. The person I talked with was XXXX XXXX. They talk very vague and almost come across as a scam. I will NOT be paying my debt thru them but I will pay it thru XXXX XXXX XXXX which is the original party to whom I am responsible for paying. Their debt collectors [ the rude company ] need to learn to show respect to their callers versus being rude and ugly to them.	1
the last XXXX of my old bank account #	1
the last being XX/XX/XXXX. Since then	1
the last email I received from my relationship manager in XXXX stated the loan was being modified and I would be receiving payment coupons soon	1
the last few times I 've logged in	1
the last not enough money and I got XXXX days late. They took 4 months to tell me this	1
the last of which I was told that they would enter into the system that I would not pay due to repair issues	1
the last one being in XX/XX/XXXX and i never received a notice to cure. I spoke to XXXX who said they had been looking for me for four months but I never received notice and my partial payments have been accepted ; they have sent me statements but no notices.	1
the last time I received the XXXX and annual statement was on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
the last time I used my chase card was on XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
the last time XX/XX/XXXX. They promised me access to my account online	1
the late fee for XXXX	1
the latest credit information I can see is through XX/XX/XXXX. The XXXX is the ONLY negative information against my report and NOTHING has changed from XX/XX/XXXX including no additional debt	1
the latest was a letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
the lawyer called they said they did not say foreclosure I had cut it out of the paper got XXXX of the nurses to fax it to the lawyer I still have that copy. They gave me until XX/XX/XXXX to re submit everything I sent in my RMA the reality stated that her person had sad he was tire of Ocwen he had changed Please I need help I tried everything his mind but on to day which is XXXX XXXX	1
the lawyer messed something up XX/XX/XXXX. We are in the process of filing a grievence against him and had to get a different lawyer we submitted another package our lawyer said they said the numbers were good It had to go to the underwriters It was turned down again I just want to stay in my house. We worked so hard on it we could have walked away after the storm but we didnt. We are hard working people we didnt go on vacations. We were trying to get a grant from the SBA for my husband tools	1
the lean on my property and other nowchecks due to Chase Bank mistake.	1
the lender : & gt ; & gt ; Took at least a month to reply to each of our requests.	1
the lender Wells Fargo is NOT being cooperative and taking too long for the process plus they have put me in FORECLOSURE status and NOT willing to extend my DUE date of XXXX XXXX 2016 ... On top of HOLIDAYS!!	1
the lender has not documented it in the Loan Estimate which they provided on Monday XXXX XXXX based on an application I made on XXXX XXXX. I have twice requested that the lender add this promised non-specific lender credit to the Loan Estimate disclosure but they have refused	1
the lender has not made any contact with me.	2
the lender may have written this debt off but collected the credits at year-end that came with the write off. Is n't this double jeopardy	1
the lender never contacted me when the loan was 1-month past due when I am the co-signer/owner of that vehicle. This issue could have been resolved without this damaging my credit and lowering my credit score prior to closing on my new home as a first-time homebuyer.	1
the length of my credit history went down from good to poor due to U.S. Bank closing my credit card account. In addition	1
the lesser amount prevails. '' From what I have found through research	1
the letter also stated that Wells Fargo was unsuccessful in their attempts to contact both the third party and myself	1
the letter did not include any statements. They only list that the charge is from XXXX XXXX and each of the XXXX pages indicates a different dollar amount. I feel that the creditor is trying to collect on a debt they do not have a legal right to collect on	1
the letter says that the payment as shown will cause the loan to be negative amortizing. I have received this type of letter before from the lender-OCWEN and asked them about the information and to provide an amortization schedule-to no avail. Their system is most likely not in compliance with federal regulations regarding the notice of payment change. Please review the letter attached and provide some clarification as this is a formal complaint.	1
the letter stated	1
the letter stated there was an authorization form attached that I would have to sign and send back for them to begin the process of obtaining a new appraisal. To my surprise there was no authorization form so I called SLS and they said I would receive a new authorization form. Three weeks later I am still waiting. I contacted my prior servicer and was told since my appraisal is not 60 days old SLS should be able to use it. At this point I think this is a stall tactic on the part of SLS. Either use my appraisal or provide me with a form so I can request one from your company. Every time I call SLS I get a different explanation. I 'm so frustrated and feel this is deliberate so that the customer will continue to pay the PMI.	1
the limit on the HELOC was only XXXX. I paid it off last week	1
the line was "" conveniently '' cutoff a XXXX of times and I was passed from XXXX rep to another until I was jaded and moved on to do other important things like my job.	1
the loan amount at XXXX does not reflect the correct principal on my loan.	1
the loan documents were mailed to the wrong address. To date	1
the loan has been paid in full	1
the loan has been sold several times and now resides with PHH. We were making payments just fine until I lost my job and we had to declare chapter XXXX bankruptcy. We filed in XXXX and the bankruptcy was discharged in XXXX. I think it stays on our credit report for 10 years. Ever since we bought the house	1
the loan has to have originated before XXXX 2009	1
the loan servicer	1
the loan that we used to accept the contract was un-able to be approved. This in turn caused me to not be able to settle on my new house. The delays of relisting my condo	1
the loan to value is 59 %	1
the loan was a XXXX balloon that carried a prepayment penalty	1
the loan was modified XX/XX/XXXX	1
the loan was sold to a private investor. Refinancing and any type of modification has been denied by the investor through the lender	1
the loan was transferred and the payoff never netted a release or satisfaction of mortgage. The loan shows transferred/sold to a new lender/servicer in XX/XX/XXXX. We are in need of the mortgage release/satisfaction of this loan.	1
the loan was transferred over to Ocwen Loan Servicing. They did not accept the loan modification that IndyMac Mortgage XXXX has agreed on and instead raised my payment ( almost XXXX it ). I wanted to see if that was legal and if there are any options that could help me?	1
the loan was transferred to Specialized Loan Servicing ( "" SLS '' ) in XXXX XXXX	1
the loan will triple and I will not be able to afford the payment. No one will help. When I 'm assigned someone	2
the loans ( at rates as high as 12 % ) racked up so much interest that I essentially will be paying for years for my service in XXXX. I believe this is outrageous treatment of someone who is doing national service and wonder why Navient -- who	1

the machine sucked all my money back in then the whole machine froze and not responding nor printed out any receipt. First	1
the major problem is were is the {$300.00}?	1
the majoroty of the & gt ; {$5000.00}	1
the manager filed a claim against me in court per se. He even went as far as to send garnishment papers to my employer without a verdict being rendered in court. I made a payment for {$450.00} via money order after that and he did n't even report it to the court. I disputed the matter on my credit and it came back as "" satisfied/released '' but	1
the maual transmission	1
the medical costs and other obligations have depleted our savings. We have been made to feel like a ping-pong reaching out to so many Lenders	1
the message center for card holders of XXXX is a joke. I Have writeen them XXXX times and keep getting emails that a reponse is in my inbox but when I go log in it says there is tech errors for months now.	1
the min payment is applied to the balance with the lowest interest rate. That means the balance with the high interest rate keeps going up and I am charged interest on top of interest for the following months. The min payment should be applied to all XXXX balances. Meaning interest charged at 22 % should be subtracted from the min payment because the min payment includes the interest charge for that month. This is a deceptive practice that discover card is practicing and has been practicing for years. It will take a lot of math to calculate how much I have lost due to this practice.	1
the minimum amount required to open was {$25.00}. I have already lost {$3.00} due to the monthly service charge.	1
the minimum required is the lesser of the loan amount	1
the miscellaneous notes on the provided document indicate that the original debt occurred on XX/XX/XXXX	1
the modification papers included me having my separated husband sign the modification documents. The modification request clearly states that I was applying for the modification to have my separated husband removed from the loan along with obtaining an affordable monthly payment which I could afford to pay with my income only. The servicer requested the quit claim deed to show proof that my husband had released his rights to the property. I provided the quit claim deed to the servicer on XXXX XXXX	1
the modification process that began in XXXX can not be considered concluded. Therefore	1
the modification was approved '' to "" the modification is being reviewed and to check back with them in a couple of months. '' Employees that no longer work at Bank of America have stated	1
the modification was never complete. This paperwork nightmare continued for the next 5 years!!!! Paperwork has been a continuous problem ... ... All the paperwork that Wells Fargo required had to be faxed	1
the mold assessment and remediation performed in our apartment unit was not done legally.	1
the money has still not been picked up by my cousin and the bank confirms that the funds are in the account	1
the money until today XXXX/XXXX/2015 at XXXX shows as in hold by money gram	1
the month before it sold	1
the month of XXXX had 31 days in it. I went to pay my bill on the XXXX of XXXX	1
the monthly charge had increased by {$80.00} to a new payment of {$1200.00}.	1
the monthly mortgage cost stayed the same. The loan originator insisted that I again get an insurer to cover the loan. Subsequently	1
the monthly payment amount was listed at {$2400.00}. I called and wrote to Resurgent to explain to them that their records from XXXX were incorrect. After nearly four months	1
the monthly payment would have been closer to {$2100.00}. According to the HUD underwriting guidelines	1
the monthly statement that were sent to my Mother/ and now to her estate	1
the mortgage changed hands and the new company is now charging me {$2600.00}. I was confused by the increase in amount as it is a fixed loan and my taxes have not gone up. I called the company multiple times to try to figure out why	1
the mortgage company	1
the mortgage company 's counsel never served me	1
the mortgage company ( Freedom Mortgage ) did not apply the amount to my principal	1
the mortgage company is trying to foreclose on our property. At age XXXX and and XXXX we do n't have much. Our hardship propelled us into BK XXXX	1
the mortgage company sent us a check for mistakes made on account. We still have check because we did n't understand why we 'd get a check from mortgage company while they were foreclosing.	1
the mortgage company. They gave me very vague information as to why this mix-up has happened & the status of my loan. Basically	1
the mortgage of their home!!??? Outrageous.	1
the mortgage processor	1
the mortgage servicer asked us to complete the modification paperwork all over again. We completed paperwork at least XXXX times only to be told we do not qualify. The last time we were told we qualified for the modification	1
the most recent being case # XXXX	1
the most the caller should have stated was their name	1
the multiple loans were consolidated into XXXX loan. I worked for a few years and was able to easily make payments. However	1
the name it was supposedly under	1
the name of the original creditor and the exact dollar amount so that the debt remains on my credit report longer than 7 years. This tactic is nasty and unfair. My past credit information is attached.	1
the name of the person they tell me they have listed for my number is n't even the last name of anyone I 've ever hired for my business.	1
the name of the vendor used and what was the steps. I would like to know if a website was used in trying to verify these tax lien and what is the address of the website. I have contacted the XXXX County Courthouse and I know it is not them providing the information so I do not want Experian to illegally tell me to contact the source when the court house was not the source used to verify the accuracy of the information. I also requested for Experian to remove the Fraud Alert from my file and provided identity verification documents for the removal of the fraud alert and yet it is still reporting on my file.	1
the negotiator person assigned to the account at the lenders will contact us to inform us. At that time we would take the appropriate actions to adjust or agree to their request so we could proceed with approval of the short sale of the home. We turned in our offer to Bank of America in time to the ATP ( approval to participate ) expiring. We also could of closed on this short sale of the home several times before if BofA would n't close this account out every time or would take so long to complete the modification requirements prior to proceeding with the short sale and or reviewing the file before the buyers walk. We have had XXXX buyers walk on this property because of the lengthy time and/or person assigned to work the account not working it or to even review the information or documents sent in. The BPO/Apprisal came back at $ XXXX and the offer we got is $ XXXX	1

the next day	2
the next day not only did I receive XXXX phone	1
the next month they claimed they could n't withdraw from the exact same checking account because it "" did n't exist ''. They never notified me of this ; I had to contact them and ask them why the payment had n't been deducted. After making sure they had the correct account number	1
the next payment is due to US Bank	1
the note is originally in the name of XXXX XXXX	1
the notice clearly stated that our monthly mortgage payment would increase to {$2500.00}.	1
the number calls again	1
the number of cards I 've cancelled and have had reissued has caused a hardship for me with other ( authorized ) creditors. I have asked over and over for a way to block this charge from being charged to my account	1
the numbers just do n't work. I will attach the details in an attached letter sent to Wells Fargo Executive Customer Service Committee	1
the offer was advertised on the XXXX XXXX website	1
the office that prepared our refinancing in XXXX	1
the one we chose was a 3.5 % on a loan of XXXX with XXXX closing costs. We chose the higher rate of the XXXX as XXXX stated we would not need income verification or an appraisal	1
the ongoing receipt of Past Due Notices in spite of making all of my agreed upon payments on time	1
the online account even shows the mortgage to have been paid on- time for the past 6 ( six ) years. On a daily basis they call and harass with threats and I continually tell them I have sent certified letters explaining the mistake and showing the mortgage to be paid as agreed.	1
the only answer I got is that an invoice was sent to me	1
the only income to the house hold is thru my husband`s work	1
the only offer given to me was to sell my property. Lastly	1
the only thing I did see on my credit report was a "" closed '' account. I thought since the account was "" closed ''	2
the operator informing us that we were in pre-foreclosure ... ..it took two more years before the sheriff arrived at our door with foreclosure papers ... .during that time	1
the operator told me we will re-send a new card in 15-20 days.	1
the opportunity to correct any errors and flat out lied about the pay incentive program to make money on a refinance I would not have done. If they were doing this to me they have done it to others. This could have been avoided with a simple phone call	1
the original agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) is no longer in business. I have no faith in Amazon.com. I fear that they will continue to try and collect a debt which has already been satisfied.	1
the original amount of {$9300.00} financed at a rate of 90 %.	1
the original balance	1
the original creditor and a statement guaranteeing that the debt amount would be updated on XXXX credit reports if I paid in full. XXXX XXXX explained that this was an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained would be used for that purpose. I was told the document would be mailed within a few days. Today	1

the outgoing message does not include the name of the company as it appears in my banking statement.	1
the owner was unable to find the registration and advised his porter to drive me back to the car lot of XXXX XXXX XXXX to pick up some temporary plates. The porter drove the vehicle to the car lot and in route	1
the owner/investor of the present note to which servicing rights were sold to XXXX	1
the parts of the house in which the XXXX violations were given existed at the time of the loan. CITI is also liable for those violations for they had knowledge that these parts of the house existed. I was unaware that the parts of the house in question were illegal and in such closed on the house after review by CITI. In such CITI is responsible in helping me out of foreclosure and assistance in taking care of the XXXX which are mandatory by XXXX	1
the party stated to me that I must overlook my responsibility and how do have I been paying my bills. Totally disrespectful and unprofessional. Called a second time on XXXX XXXX	1
the party who did the repairs failed to obtain a building permit or professionally complete the repairs. During the walk through it was evident that the roof was still leaking. A licensed roofing contractor provided me with an inspection and estimate to replace the roof since a repair is not permitted. The city building department confirmed that a complete roof replacement is required and has issued a stop work order posted on the property. The roof must be replaced by a licensed roofing contractor	1
the past due amount was {$7800.00}. I sent a check for that amount to GreenTree. A few weeks later I received a letter stating that GreenTree was now Ditech	1
the payment amount in excess of the minimum payment due will be applied to the deferred interest promotion ( s ) that are in the month of expiration and/or the month prior to expiration.	1
the payment history shows I was credited with paying only {$XXXX}. At the beginning of the loan the pay-off was {$XXXX}. During the past year	1
the payment may be reported negativity. I do n't show that anywhere or have I ever in my years in banking known that the payment has to be made in the same month.	1
the payment was made for the XXXX and the money came out of my account on the XXXX ( it was showing as pending in my checking acct on the XXXX ). Mohela has did this to me before	1
the payment was taken incorrectly and it would be reversed. This process would take 24-48 hours. I waited for the deposit into my account	1
the payment went back to the regular amount of XXXX. This is our second mortgage. We have a 1st mortgage and the payment is already XXXX. That brings my total mortgage payment to XXXX ; this is TOO MUCH for my budget. I called Green Tree Servicing about the change and no one could explain the exact reason for the change except saying that the loan had went back to the original amount. I was also told that I had received enough help and I need to pay the original amount. While reading the lawsuit filed by CFPB I realized that been victims of all of the violations noted in the lawsuit. There are several things that Green Tree Servicing has done	1
the payments increased from the original {$700.00} to {$1100.00}	1
the payments were always automatically withdrawn from our bank accounts. We also chose the option of receiving the electronic billing statement. Suddenly since XXXX XXXX	1
the payoff was signed for by XXXX at their office. On XXXX XXXX	1
the pending status never changed	1
the pensions I receive are for life yet the XXXX months of bank statements they ask for have to be less than XXXX days old and they at first but they are stalling long enough and maintain the missing documents game so that I can never get all the documents in with the right dates. Communicating with the representative they assign is impossible his accent is so heavy I do not know what he is saying and he does not listen I have repeatedly written letters explaining the status of the rental. I am not renting my house I am just renting XXXX bedroom. I just know that one day soon my house will be in a foreclosure sale. I believe they are doing this on purpose because I owe less than {$80000.00} but the house is worth {$110000.00} without any improvements made. It is like playing the old shells con and Ocwen is the XXXX. They shuffle the documents and remove them from the shell so no matter what I can not get it right.	1
the people that have my card can setup payments if they like under different company names which my have happened on XXXX for {$49.00} XXXX cleverbridge. My husband or myself did not order it so I have to now have my new account closed again and reopened yet again. Another person that would stop in a couple of days two weeks it is still happening.. I have XXXX more charges from my old account on my new account. Now on what they have done to with our checking. We had a scam/fraud company playing with my husband 's federal student loans that they did not do anything with. We payed them XXXX payments of {$230.00} each XXXX in XXXX	1
the people who are supposed to be there to help me with that decide to leave early for the day or the weekend	1
the perpetrator has not been prosecuted although police reports have been filed. I have lost work wages trying to dispute and fix the issue while my credit is now ruined. I placed fraud alerts on my credit bureau accounts and disputed the fraudulent accounts. I have not received responses from any credit bureau and the fraudulent accounts are still on my report.	1
the person I spoke with on the phone said	1
the person who switched my account failed to switch my phone to the new business account. So	1
the personal information is still being stored in plain-text at Scottrade and accessible by numerous people. Scottrade refused to address the issue and still refuses to respond.	1
the phone no. was out of order and the management at the building in XXXX never heard of him nor the owner.	1
the police came and basically just told him to leave. I have repeatedly requested for them to stop calling her and I have requested on more than one occasion for them to provide documentation on how much is still owed if anything	1
the police were called and I was told again to leave and file a restraining order by the police and not come back. I went directly to the property manager again ( XXXX XXXX ) I explained with the police report and new restraining order that it was unsafe for me and my daughter to live at the property. I was told by XXXX that if I leave and vacate all of the furniture I could not be billed. In XXXX I was billed for {$13000.00}. I forwarded the information to a XXXX XXXX Attorney who informed me that they would help me because legally I should not be responsible. In XX/XX/XXXX I was billed again for {$3200.00}	1
the position that Peoples has chosen to adopt is incomprehensible.	1
the potential return on investment is 2	1
the practice of posting credit card payments ( made after XX/XX/XXXX on the due date )	1
the present the flex loan like a credit card and I have those and the definitely do not work they way this company is telling their customers.	1
the previous house has not been foreclosed on ( and we need to wait 2 years after the foreclosure to qualify for an FHA loan ) we are unable to purchase a house. I called the mortgage servicer and they told me that they ca n't rush the foreclosure any faster it 's ( almost 3 years )	1
the previous order was never completed. I 've applied a total of approximately {$5800.00} toward my escrow and Ocwen refuses to recalculate my monthly payments.	1
the price went up from $ XXXX to {$410.00} as final price.	1
the principal balance stayed constant at {$16000.00} from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX although I was making payments. Again	1
the principle balance has been paid from the mortgage loan	1
the problem is they are servicing loan for the government the same place I am filing a complaint. Now they are taking extra money in my monthly statement and can not explain to my why. This company has more complaints than any company on the planet but nothing is being done because they are working for the US government. First they took money for taxes but my taxes were paid Now they are taking money for HOA but my HOA dues are current.	1
the process still did not conclude with a forbearance issued. The last representative ( XXXX ) I spoke to in early XXXX said they received every single form	1
the processing center processed the check and it came through my bank prior to XXXX XXXX. On XXXX XXXX	1
the processor at Green Tree closed the file without letting anyone know. I contact the manager at Green Tree for help and he did n't help at all. Now the title is clear and I want to close the loan asap. It looks like Green Tree does n't want to refi my home. Please help.	1
the processor said something to the effect of "" uh-oh looks like your rate lock is going to expire on XXXX XXXX	1
the promotional offer code must be submitted at the time the account is opened. I called their CS # XXXX ( XXXX	1
the property could not be rebuilt to its current footprint if substantially destroyed. We suspected an error was made	1
the property manager that cleared me from the residence. So how can 2 months go by and they decide to charge me. I beleive the residence was vacant until that time. The repairs are petty in my opion. I do n't understand how can there be so much damage. I was XXXX for XXXX months out of the 3yrs I was renting the residence and I lived alone.	1
the property tax payment of {$4400.00} was taken from my escrow account on XXXX/XXXX/15 ( 4 weeks before due date of XXXX/XXXX/15 ). I contacted Loan Depot to inquire about this on XXXX/XXXX/15 and was informed that the property tax payment was being held XXXX for XXXX weeks by before being paid to the XXXX XXXX Tax Assessor 's office prior to the due date at the end of the month. I requested that this payment be stopped by LoanDepot and XXXX due to the fact that it was already paid by the buyer	1
the property was property tax exempt at the time but despite almost a year of paper work and meeting the problem continued. They also often held payments made to the branch on time for several days before processing as to incure late fees and overages. A short time after my mothers ex-husband filed for his own personal bankruptcy the bank would no longer accept payments on the mortgage nor provide any statements	1
the purchases that were made and signed documents. If not	1
the put me in a loop of "" customer service '' - patronizing people who "" understand my frustration '' but offer no help.	1
the questions they asked were pretty straight forward. 1. ) Mortgage loan. - Well I 've never owned a home. Obviously the answer is none of the above. 2. ) Monthly payment of above loan - Well I do n't have one. Obviously the answer is none of the above. 3. ) Address associated with my credit - I know where I 've lived. 4. ) Auto loan I just paid off last month - I know what bank I 've been paying each month for years. YET! It tells me that information is wrong. Simply due to clear inaccuracies of their "" records '' and now being concerned about possible identity theft I phoned multiple times to receive another free report in which I 'm ENTITLED TO BY FEDERAL LAW. Spoke with numerous people	1
the rate would be higher. This makes no sense at all	1
the reason JKW did not except my money at the court proceedings was because they wanted me out for reporting them to housing authorities. Third	1
the reason being that I went over the limit because the bank made a mistake and transferred {$1200.00} XXXX times back to my checking account instead of XXXX. I called the bank	1
the reason for denial was given to myself on XXXX XXXX	1
the reasoning my security deposit is held and my rights to dispute and I have never received anything like that. I am told that they have photo 's	1
the receipts and the letter from XXXX XXXX. I received a response back that no further action was required and I did not owe the money. This was early in XXXX. On XXXX XXXX	1
the recipient Name and account number. I was put on hold again for a lengthy time. When she returned she indicated that although she could not divulge any details to me that the account had been flagged as being used for fraudulent activity and a HOLD was placed on it. Further I was told to "" PUSH the issue '' with my bank and that my bank ( XXXX ) must submit a Hold Harmless Agreement. ( Having worked in banking for many years I then used M & Ts automated system along with the recipients info that I DID HAVE and did a "" Check Verification '' for the amount of {$7800.00}. The system DID indicate the account was still with M & T and their were funds available to cover a {$7800.00} check. This was on XXXX/XXXX/15 at approximately XXXX XXXX. ) I then contacted XXXX again	1
the recorders office has not received anything from US Bank. In fact	1
the refy loan was provided without asking any questions of the borrower. While they did go on line to review the household income	1
the remainder would be applied on balances with higher interest rates OR if I used a balance transfer from another company	1
the rental income I reported on my Request for Modification ( RMA ) was missing from the calculations for the gross monthly income without any explanation whatsoever as to why all - or some of it - was not included in the NPV calculations. If they - Nationstar - can not do simple math to compute my gross monthly earnings	1
the renters that where in my home skipped out on 2.5 months of rent putting me in a bind. I am currently only working XXXX part- time jobs and can not make up the missing monthly payments so I applied for hardship. I do not have a phone as I am unable to pay for a cellphone or monthly service. I am living paycheck to paycheck and am so tired of the run -around. I need help	1
the rep advised me that my auto payments were submitted successfully but they were submitted after my cycle end date	1
the rep asked me to make a copy and fax to them. I do not feel comfortable	1
the rep could offer was that my grandmother had to call in herself. I asked what	1
the rep from XXXX stated that with the return of the equipment that the account was satisfied.	1
the rep informed me that XXXX sent the debt to them to collect in XXXX XXXX ; however	1
the rep informed me that the systems were down and he would call me back to complete the transaction. I did n't receive a callback so I assumed that everything was taken care of.	1
the rep refused to give me that information	1
the rep replied he was n't allowed to tell me. I asked to speak to the legal dept. and that was n't allowed either. On XXXX XXXX	1
the rep reviewed the paperwork on her computer screen and just ran thru the documents quickly	1
the rep was n't aware of anyway to file a complaint. He offered for me to speak with his supervisor. I spoke with supervisor "" XXXX '' who said she would file a payment dispute. She continued to say they would not waive the fee as Wells Fargo did n't make an error. She kept saying they send out statements and that I just need to read them. My main point of frustation and complaint is that I was paying at an accelerated rate and made a best faith attempt to not only be current but pay more than required. What I failed to realize	1
the replacement cabinets would arrive with staple marks showing on all end cabinets. He ordered us skins to put on the end cabinets ; which we had to pay our installer to cut down to size and install. This was not told to us by the salesperson. She obviously wanted a sale so she omitted pertinent information we needed to make an educated decision. We still had issues with the cabinets and called Capital One to let them know what kind of company they were representing. They stopped taking and returning my calls after XXXX told me that Menards would have the cabinet company call me to fix the problem. To this day	1
the report incorrectly included the name "" XXXX XXXX '' as one of my reported names. ( The attached photos show the XXXX incorrect places this name appears. ) I am entitled to a more thorough investigation of this matter	1
the reports and the addendum asking for a reduction in the purchase price. The closer XXXX XXXX	1
the representative ( XXXX ) I spoke with confirmed the amount and also told me that by making the {$3200.00} payment my next payment would be {$1400.00} for the XXXX payment. I began to schedule weekly payments of {$810.00} so that I would have the full amount paid by the end of XXXX. When he began to confirm the payments I was notified that each payment would incur a {$12.00} fee	1
the representative I spoke with said that she placed an order for the account history and original note paperwork	1
the representative failed to even apprehend that I was trying to report a fraud. He simply offered to refund me money. I explained that I had not actually lost any money	1
the representative informed me that I have an additional promotion ( that I have no idea how I signed up for ) that is set to expire in XXXX 2015 which will drive this {$1800.00} debt to close to if not more than {$3000.00}. After speaking with a financial representative for over XXXX minutes he advised me that I "" did not qualify '' for assistance at this time and to try back later	1
the representative informed me that I needed to complete a statement of fraud	1
the representative refused to provide information but the representative provided the SAME information independently	1
the representative started laughing at me and my situation. This is now the person who they have assigned to assist me with my mortgage. Also	1
the representative stated the account was forward to DUVERA XXXX. But on the credit report	1
the representative there referred me to the Deposit Account Agreement. I read thoroughly the DPA and there is nothing stating that I am required to provide my account information to change a {$10.00} bill for quarters. I find it personally offensive to have to provide my account information in order to conduct a simple small monetary transaction. If Chase or the government has such a policy	1
the representative told me that if I did not receive any call from them	1
the representative was able to confirm it and said that they would correct the issue. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
the representative we spoke with	1
the representative would not tell me the nature of the delivery	1
the representatives could not initially determine why I was calling ( apparently the form letters are not coded to allow identification of the department requesting me to call ). When I was	1
the reps refuse to remove our number from their list.	1
the request for documentation was sent to allied via USPS and was ultimately ignored. They have continued to call me	1
the requests for documentation went back 4 years and were both intrusive and onerous. We understand all these loans get sold to XXXX and XXXX XXXX	1
the requirements are different - we were misled and our rights have been violated.	1
the response is always : "" Well	1
the response was that the phone number was not validated. My current address has not changed in almost 5 years and current phone number has not changed in over XXXX. I spoke with a regular employee and manager. I was badged by the manager who stated	1
the result of fees and interest and if I did not pay the entire amount she would not remedy my credit report. My credit history is excellent and had I received a statement my credit history shows I would have paid it off immediately. I should n't be held accountable for these exorbitant fees and charges due to BoA 's oversight in not including the original charge to the payoff amount in a timely manner.	1
the result of which is increased risk to me.	1
the result was still the same ... always a page or XXXX missing that required me to fill out forms again. I kept every piece of paper and documentation of this XXXX that Chase put me through. I finally got it resolved after I cried like a baby to a manager at one of their bank. Manager faxed each sheet of paper and verified that it was received - I got my house out of foreclosure.	1
the return XXXX be used to calculate an unspecified amount of credit toward the debt owed.	1
the reverse mortgage company made a highly unusual payment of taxes on the property. As the personal representative over the estate	1
the right hand has no clue what the left hand is doing and I 've had to spend my valuable time doing this research- I was on the phone for just shy of an HOUR with them on XXXX XXXX unacceptable!	1
the rude representative told me that "" I signed '' an agreement saying that the no interest period was 12 months. That is n't mentioned in the agreement I signed. According to my records I did not sign any such thing. Unless they can furnish the document	1
the running total is not accurate and other hidden charges. If you lose your receipt	1
the sales receipt	1
the salesperson brought a document for me to sign. I looked over the document and notified the salesperson that I would sign	1
the same XXXX they had just paid ) to cover the overdraft in the checking account and charged that account another {$35.00} for paying the overdraft. Another option that I had specifically exercised to not implement because of the outrageous fee they were going to charge for as little as covering a {$1.00} overdraft. They set the system up so they would make {$70.00} for any possible overdraft if you let them tie it to your credit card account. After speaking with the Wells Fargo claims department after sending them an email detailing the problem	1
the same item showed up again on my credit report. They did not send me any notices it just showed up again. At this point I do not know what to do with them.	1
the same payment was processed through the proper account at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. At this point	1
the same set of events occurred on XX/XX/XXXX and involves a {$26.00} late fee	1
the same week I completed the hardship package and was going to email it	1
the same wrong accounting started again. Soon thereafter I received CitiMortgage 's threatening letters and automated phone calls. I took the time to communicate with the person on the other end of the phone line and have been assured several times that this matter had been solved. However	1
the school never helped me with a solid lead for a career	1
the school told me I would need another student loan to continue my education. Again	1
the scotus ruling on XXXX vs XXXX	1
the second part of a whole	1
the server threw the papers in the door onto the floor and walked off without saying anything. Further demands and threatening behavior.	2
the service fees added. I listed my house to sell in XXXX as well.	1
the service rep for XXXX oh yes	1
the servicer for XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' )	1
the servicer unilaterally attempted to change the terms of the modification. Our payment would rise and our Balloon Payment was going to rise from {$200000.00} to over {$800000.00}. We have refused to accept the change as it is NOT beneficial. Recently	1
the settlement agent. Additionally	1
the short sale never happened and the buyer walked away. We were strung along with promises by Ocwen that became torture and stressful for our family. But that is not what I am writing about today. We want to do the right thing and we have made the changes and sacrifices we needed to stabilize our situation. As of now	1
the should be some type of Social Worker or someone somewhere that I can sit and talk with about my Identity being stolen. Besides having the banks not help solve the problem the IRS should note how people money get stolen from the banks every year or whenever it is stolen and not replace that revenue of a person money and possibly others that do n't get to spend their own money that are stolen by banks and employee of the bank. I got a police report of my card being stolen the very same day and I did report it to the bank even though they wrote some type of letter from their dept. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX SC XXXX. Both Checking and Saving Account at XXXX Banks fees and money missing.	1
the signature line for both has typed "" signed electronically ''. The School Certification section is completely blank except fot the school ID code and there are no signatures from any school official on the application	1
the signature line was incorrect!!! Now for the XXXX time the subordination agreement is with them to be completed and they are still dragging their feet. this was to refi my ARM to a fixed rate loan lowering my payment by over a {$1000.00} per month. To get either company moving I keep escalating my complaints but they both are so incompetent. They are happy to take my payment on time each month for the last 10 years of course when I refinance	1
the signup bonus for me was worth XXXX XXXX XXXX points. Three weeks after they told me that the ratio is going to change : to get XXXX XXXX XXXX points	1
the site will be difficult for him and could result in loan default. PLEASE help fix this mess. I dislike having to work with these private loan companies. Then	1
the sound dropped for approximately 10 seconds	1
the staff member was extremely rude and derogatory. I stated several times that I had never been notifed by her company about this supposed debt and as such I asked to speak to a Supervisor at this time ; the employee refused to transfer my call stating that until we work out a plan to settle the debt	1
the statement amount is {$5900.00}. I have tried to make the payments to Nationstar Mortgage	1
the statement come to my hand	1
the statement read "" not a bill ''	1
the statements all say the same info every month. We are still behind {$1200.00}. When I went through my bank statements and what has been paid to them in the last 5 months	1
the statute of limitations expired in XXXX XXXX.	1
the statute of limitations has run on the debt. P & L Acquisitions sent me a litigation notice about the debt. The amount listed in the "" Amount Owed '' section is {$2600.00}. The original debt was {$1000.00}. I spoke to XXXX XXXX	1
the statute of limitations on bad checks in the state of California is 2 years. My concern is how this company got my information. This is an invasion of privacy. My phone numbers are not publicly listed.	1
the student who was lured into taking out loans to pay for my education.	1
the supervisor of XXXX. After two hour	1
the supervisor understood why we were disputing the late fee charges and submitted the documentation for someone to look because of the dispute of the payment dates. The company is now asking for our credit report for these years during the time the XXXX had the mortgage. The credit report will not prove anything because XXXX XXXX charged us for being late which its records bear out	1
the supervisor was awful and told me it was my own fault for not checking with XXXX XXXX sooner.	1
the system automatically ask the person to contact customer service and the applicant is unable to continue the process. This flaw in the Target online application process will hurt many consumer credit rating just by automatically pulling credit regardless if they were identified or unable to indentify the person applying for credit. Identity fraud is on the rise	1
the system prompted me to enter XXXX for XXXX of the company reports - I do n't remember which	1
the tax board did not receive my tax return and issued a hold on my account on my account which was received by the Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. Bank of America withdrew its XXXX legal fees	1
the taxes were disbursed on XXXX XXXX	1
the taxes were increased. The realtor XXXX Weichert in New Jersey XXXX had not mentioned this to me at all prior to my purchase	1
the teller gave me my funds and I left. My debit card arrived in the mail on XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
the teller was ready to release my withdrawal but it was her limit so she asked her manager for approval and the manager she started reviewing my account and make the teller to call the XXXX. They say they can not verify check and I was not given or neither serve notice of funds to be held. So I belief Chase bank to be penalized for the illegal practice and they should pay a fine to me the consumer for pain and suffering. We are ready to prepare a civil lawsuit if this matter do not resolve ASAP.	1
the tellers have to ask for an override to be able to deposit money into my account. They ask for an override and a manager has to come to the desk and allow them to deposit my money. So I am not only financially punished but I am infantalized and embarrassed in the process. All of these overdrafts and this infantalizing are causing me XXXX as I ca n't afford for this to happen over and over again. I also am taking valuable time out of my day to write these complaints which is affecting my ability to do my work.	1
the tenant are very happy to pay the rent and I am extremely happy to start paying the mortgage on a timely basis.	3
the terms - is packaged in a way to confuse and mislead.	1
the terms of the mortgage were based on a 60 % LTV which was exactly the {$190000.00} I needed to pay off my existing mortgage. This was never explained to me until after I was sent a new good faith estimate which required me to pay an additional {$1200.00} because the appraisal came back at {$310000.00}. When I questioned the appraisal	1
the thieves have gotten credit cards from XXXX XXXX each time anyway	1
the third party provided written documentation to AMEX stating that they were a telemarketing firm and had to charge people to stay in business	1
the third party whom they have the agreement with is XXXX. It 's a whirlwind of confusion. XXXX XXXX XXXX a XXXX Resmac	1
the title	1
the total amount being sued is almost double the amount owed. Since the withdrawal of the levy in XXXX 2015	1
the transaction did not go through today because I now have a negative checking account balance of {$2900.00} dollars. The bank says because I gave the loan officer my account information and made the transactions	1
the transaction would be rejected for insufficient funds! When I asked how that was possible	1
the transfer money was XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX dollars )	1
the travel notification online was no longer an option because of that alert. They 've now locked me out of my online account access	1
the trial payments I have been making is the same amount I was paying prior to the loan modification. I called and questioned if this were truly a modification	1
the trustee is a duty to act impartially and in good faith to the borrower	1
the unapproved loan on an amount less than 50 % of value does not make sense. Not one person has been able to explain the risk involved for the loan amount requested on this property. We were only told that the appraisal is too high and they will not approve it. We must start the entire process over with another Mortgage Lender. If they have an issue with Florida they should be up front and disclose their Florida State paranoia and have us go to a mortgage lender who does not discriminate against residents of the state of Florida.	1
the unit would be sparsely furnished	1
the updated pay stubs reflected a pay raise in my wife 's income	1
the value of my VA home had droppedbelow {$400000.00}	1
the value of my house was approximately XXXX dollars according to XXXX XXXX appraiser. Now I am in a dispute with SPS who states my home is now worth XXXX dollars even though we have an appraisal at XXXX which was completed on XX/XX/XXXX. SPS refuses to accept the correct value	1
the vandalism and squatters on the property. He said that he had to secure this home and call the police department multiple times but Ocwen did not do anything about it. Since XXXX	1
the vehicle has not been in good running condition nor safe to drive since then. I attempted to replace the vehicle and called the sales rep. that processed the sale of my vehicle	1
the vehicle was acting up and the engine started on fire where the insurance deemed it to be totaled.	1
the vehicles can be repaired to legally satisfy EPA emission standards. The matter is well know and rather than explain it further	1
the verified by XXXX window disappeared	1
the way I usually do.	1
the way Sallie Mae has handled and	1
the web site constantly goes down	1
the web site is trying to require me to make BOTH THE XX/XX/XXXX AND XX/XX/XXXX PAYMENTS PLUS PENALITIES PLUS A {$10.00} EXPEDITED PAYMENT FEE. I have called Ocwen and emailed BOTH the ombudsmans office and customer service	1
the website wo n't let me fix the issue.	1
the week of XXXX XXXX. I called and told them I did n't want the truck anymore because they had n't changed the name on the loan. I also requested the payments that I made be returned to my account. After that	1
the withdraw of my account and the deposit into his son 's account. I also emailed a copy of the receipt for the stamped envelopes purchased. Then he texted he was working on the newsletters that would be available that Sunday and reminded me about the painting being shipped to me on Tuesday.	1
the woman bank official talked me into taking only what I actually needed and leave the remaining sum to maturity. She did not tell me I would have to pay a bank fee because the amount required to retain the accounts had dropped below their required minimum. I found out by going on line to view my accounts on XX/XX/XXXX the bank had deducted {$25.00} from my checking account. I went to the bank immediately	1
the woman was telling me that I HAD TO HAVE FILLED SOMETHING OUT on line. I called back and asked for the manager	1
the words "" Capital One Business Platinum '' are printed as well as "" XXXX XXXX	1
the wrong interest rate. Can hardly get anyone on the phone. when I do they are very nice	1
their Fact Sheet and Brochure	1
their XXXX XXXX indicated that I was never really in a repayment program	1
their answering machine does not identify them as AmSher or any other company. Previously	1
their cooperation ended. Contact was made with Dyck O'neal. Dyke O'neal provided a payoff. After which time the request for the Assignments of Mortgage were requested. As they were not recorded and in dire need to show ownership of this mortgage. Nothing was done. XXXX	1
their cooperation ended. Contact was made with XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX provided a payoff. After which time the request for the Assignments of Mortgage were requested. As they were not recorded and in dire need to show ownership of this mortgage. Nothing was done. BOA	1
their corporate office	1
their current reporting of my account will not be revised. I find their decision totally unacceptable. I feel that I am being penalized for the actions of XXXX	1
their fault	1
their fax line doesnot pick up. When I try to submit it online	1
their fraud department would n't even engage in a civil conversation about the specific details of the scheme that was meant to defraud me.	1
their main purpose is to exhaust all their avenues rather than refund the warranty. When I do buy a car again you can best believe Santander comsumer USA	1
their modification was to extend the term by 10 years ; raise the interest rate from XXXX to 4.375 % ; add a deferred XXXX for {$16000.00}	1
their phone number NFCU 's XXXX is always busy and NFCU is rude and refuses to address this issue. If the accounts of service members are being compromised then this is a national security issue. At the very least their should be correspondence from NFCU to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
their principal place of business is XXXX	1
their prior response to my CFPB complaint was worthless - it was nothing more than a computer generated response saying that they take customer service seriously. What a joke	1
their products and services. They have not been an advocate for me.	1
their reporting to the Credit Bureau has caused our credit rating to drop XXXX points. Repeated phone calls to the mortgage company has only created more problems. We have documented proof of every payment made	1
their request went unanswered as well. I am now contacting FCPB to help me get this resolved.	1
their respond seem to coincide with BOA and suggest I contact CFPB for further assistance if I am not satisfied with the resolution.	1
their response was that nothing could be done	1
their reviews are all the same	1
their right to collect. Instead of responding to me they put the "" open date '' on my credit reports as XX/XX/XXXX suggesting that 's the age of the supposed delinquency instead of my last contact with XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I want them to follow the FCRA and remove that line item on my credit report ( from all XXXX CRA ).	1
their routing number	1
their score is so underrated that I had to consider signing up with other credit bureaus because Equifax credit score is so low is hurting my credit history. Equifax should be placed out of business.	1
their site removed me in less than 30 seconds from being in my report. When I ask if they could reset so I could get in since it was the same day. I was told to every question "" No	1
their story is that the {$2.00} is interest that failed to get tacked on to the XXXX bill	1
their terms countless times	1
their website was acting up ( kept freezing up ) when I made the payment and I thought it went through and because of my error I triggered a credit downgrade	1
them	1
them not responding and calling	1
then "" charge off '' again XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX	1
then 3 payments or {$2000.00} plus now it 's {$2400.00} to settle debt that I do NOT owe. I have told them REPEATEDLY to straighten it out	1
then 5 minutes before the foreclosure they postponed the foreclosure for offer review again. That was on XXXX XXXX	1
then Capital One would have every reason to report it in this manner	1
then Chase agreed to give me a refund in the meantime while they handled the dispute with the merchants and would send me a new debit card to ensure no further unauthorized charges. All while this is going on	1
then I called back and got the same answer. My son must have made the purchases. So I asked them for proof	1
then I entered the wrong check numbers ( when they dont even request check # 's online )	1
then I find out when I call XXXX Bank that they Sold my property to BSI Financial Services. On XXXX XXXX	1
then I get another message that since I sent in the {$560.00}	1
then I got yet another call just now. I finally called them myself and XXXX XXXX from the XXXX office basically said he thought I was lying about the calls and declined to listen to XXXX of the XXXX+ messages I have saved to my phone from after the firm received my cease and desist. If this is not harassment	1
then I had no other option ). She finally admitted ( unwillingly ) that I would have to call in again and file another claim and they will cancel my debit card and issue a new card. I am uncertain why she withheld that information from me at XXXX but it was evident that Chase did not want to help me get my money back from XXXX. I called in this morning because the transaction has now posted	1
then I have no idea what debt they 're talking about. So today I asked the lady to provide me with proof of the debt. She became defensive and kept talking about how XXXX would get in touch with her. I explained that I wanted to know what the debt was and that as the consumer she was trying to collect from	1
then I have to contact them multiple times out the year just to ensure the correct amount is paid on my taxes. This is the worst company!! When I returned home from work	1
then I was told I made too much. Finally	1
then I would like to request that it be investigated by the appropriate authorities.	1
then Union Bank employees would make contact via phone and instructing them that the account was over drawn then having the merchant re-send the payment back using my Savings account on XXXX different transmissions. Union Bank on-line statements will show and prove that at that time	1
then XXXX	1
then a Minimum Interest Charge of {$1.00} will be assessed on the account. This fee is in lieu of any interest charge. '' I have accrued {$0.00} interest thus far due to my promotional APR rate of 0.00 %	1
then a few days later I got a check in the mail from XXXX which I cashed and got my credit card company to drop the charge-back. However	1
then a judgement is possible to obtain illegally.	1
then a medical debt	1
then after several attempt finally my first loan modification was approved	1
then after several attempts to talk with someone concerning our loan they said there was a computer error back in XXXX that dropped our PMI and lowered our mortgage payment so for a year we paid what was in our statement each month from American Financial and also XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX we paid XXXX the {$4000.00} plus took our mortgage payment from {$1600.00} to {$1900.00}. We was told by both mortgage companies there was nothing we could do nor was either willing to work with us on a problem on there behalf. Is there anything that can be done about this?	1
then after several attempts to talk with someone concerning our loan they said there was a computer error back in XXXX that dropped our PMI and lowered our mortgage payment so for a year we paid what was in our statement each month from XXXX XXXX and also Seneca. In XX/XX/XXXX we paid Seneca the {$4000.00} plus took our mortgage payment from {$1600.00} to {$1900.00}. We was told by both mortgage companies there was nothing we could do nor was either willing to work with us on a problem on there behalf. Is there anything that can be done about this?	1
then another inquiry from them XXXX XXXX	1
then applied	1
then applied is after I paid over the phone and then took the payoff amount 5 days to process that in turn leaving us to owe money that we do n't have! Terrible and sad that this is okay in the work of money	1
then apply for hardship assistance	1
then asking me to login again. Then Manager XXXX XXXX said	1
then at the end of the year ( 2006 XXXX	1
then back to customer service	1
then by not providing an option to pay more than the minimum monthly payment in order to expedite the repayment of the principle	1
then calling. i wanted to refinance so i began the process. ultimately	1
then came back and told me that she had the XXXX supervisor that was on a conference call and the other that was not at her desk. I told her that I would wait for the conference call supervisor	1
then channeling my incoming calls to an exec who is almost never available	1
then closed my account after 6-7 months	1
then continued to email them on XX/XX/XXXX	1
then debited my acct a XXXX time. The Mgr and the Supervisor both admitted knowing this but did nothing about the additional money being taken out of my acct. I asked if being off balance by {$4500.00} at the end of the day was just normal practice and was greeted by blank stares. They agreed to put the {$4500.00} back into my acct and would cover all fees charged to me by their bank but could do nothing about fees charged me by the "" other end '' ie all the bounced checks they were responsible for causing. About {$240.00} was credited back to my acct by the bank. I have to say that once I showed them what they had done	1
then debiting the account again. These XXXX transactions are visible on my account but only XXXX debit and XXXX credit is visible on her account. I was why was n't a notified of this immediately when they took the money out of my account	1
then denied me outright. I am getting the run around for 4 months. I filed bankruptcy and can not afford to keep this home.	1
then either mail them a check or make a phone payment ( for a fee ) for the additional amount. After complaining about this for several months	1
then explained only my Employer or their Payroll department could Transfer my remaining balance on the original "" reported '' Lost or Stolen Card # XXXX to New replacement card # XXXX. Also	1
then failed to recognize the error for more than a year. Now	1
then given false info abt title company called them was fixed loan processor still no communication after calls & emails. I called the ditech guy he then called a supervisor gave me another person as loan processor. She said things needed fixed before closing well all this time 2 months no one told us	1
then got me denied. I want my Trial Payment approval as they offer me and to correct what ever mistake they did to my loan.	1
then harass me at any given time they feel like calling me	1
then having a reason for pushing it back. I have been trying to get this divorce settlement for over a year and this is the reason that I could not pay the XXXX bill. The original bill amount was XXXX. I would happily set up to pay this amount. XXXX XXXX XXXX led me to believe that the amount he quoted me was the original debt amount	1
then he asked for the last XXXX of my SSN	1
then he tried again the following day but still he was n't able to get the money. On Wednesday I called Western Union and asked for my money back	1
then he would hang up	1
then hung up. Due to the fact my information was shared over the phone without my consent	1
then i received a next call that i owe 2 months of mortgage XXXX and XXXX of 2015 in the amount of {$1900.00} dollars	1
then i was told i owe {$400.00}. tlus in escrow fees i started argueing with them then they said if i pay the {$400.00}. plus in escrow fees my mortgage will go down i sent them a for $ XXXX.plus and another check for $ XXXX.plus i i call them and ask them what happen to the check i send for my escrow they told me that they put it in an account i then said that check was sentfor my escrow on the check i wrote for escrow account so i was duped like many others home owners like myself who lost their homes to ocwen mortgage co. i sent a complain to the attorney general Pam Bondi i receive a letter saying they are looking into this	1
then in XXXX/XXXX/XXXX IC Systems in XXXX XXXX	1
then in the meantime how much paperwork is set to expire??? At this rate it will never get done. After mislabeling our paperwork for weeks you really cant accelerate our documents for review. But your ready to accelerate the mortgage.	1
then in turn	1
then it changed to {$1000.00} now they say I owe {$1000.00} which includes the {$140.00} escrow shortage I already paid. I need help this company is very crooked.	1
then it did ring a XXXX times and no one picked up	1
then it has been worth it.	2
then it is assigned to newperson. Wells Fargo had stated on the phone	1
then it would have been modified to 2 % -4 % and all would have been done. But instead they kept denying the mod request due to it was not my father 's primary residence. That is not an acceptable denial reason	1
then it would take 10 days to accomplish it. At the end of the discussion with PHH tonight we were again told that they would continue to look into it and see what they could do. Once again	1
then its representatives claim that "" it is pass sixty or ninety days allowed '' ). Therefore	1
then just recently in XXXX my grandmother passed away and we all had to help with the funeral payments. I was working 10 months a year because I work for the XXXX	1
then larger ) and send the money out from the account without any additional verification being asked for by the provider of the service.	1
then leave the messto my family and the new land owner in an effortto make a quick profit- this is fraud. The Bank is Sun Trust.	1
then loan denied abruptly. No further communication. We received a pre-approval in XX/XX/XXXX by company system	1
then message says it is recorded and when asking about use of non-recorded line is put on hold and then told "" unrecorded line is n't available	1
then more time for them to post the payment. As such	1
then my modified payment would be actually more than 25 % of my income and I should qualify. ( See attached actual appeal letter for more detailed explanation ). This is a cut and dry appeal with no questions there was an error. However	1
then my surgeon told me that I could no longer XXXX.	1
then no one can collect on this debt per my state. Since NCT ca n't prove they still own this debt then the entire balance has to be forgiven or a reasonable pay plan has to be set up. AES and NCT are in this fraud together. I will keep complaining until my credit is restored and these loans are taken off my credit report except for loan XXXX which is cosigned. Per the state of Illinois	1
then nothing	1
then ok. But we have not been given an adequate explanation for denial or explained the appeal process or allowed to seek other options	1
then on the refi promissory Note & from my personal check which CountryWide monitized. Also I signed forms that were not fully disclosed to me. I did not know that by signing the forms	1
then outstanding principal. I can only make extra principal reduction payments in a branch or via a separate payment. Can they change payment terms on me? My loan indicates that any changes must be approved by me.	1
then paid the remainder and then notified me that my payment now must include XXXX months of an escrow payment. The escrow payment they demanded each month would total {$10000.00} per year. However	1
then placed the order and received confirmation email on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Then XXXX emailed and let me go to their local store and get my identification verified	1
then proceeded to delete it from my XXXX file	1
then purchased by another dept. collector who has purchased my personal information without my permission. I have no such of any kind of contract with this furnisher. I think that it is appalling that you insist on reporting derogatory and false information on my file. I am asking you to provide me with all documents to support this data. Your dates are not accurate	2
then put me on hold and then told me Wells Fargo was keeping my balance! After being escalated to an executive custome service person I was then told the agent would be contacted again. I shared my concern about hearing several different stories over the past weeks but the only answer was that they would contact the agent and I could call back. Due to hearing several different stories and the amount being XXXX	1
then refund my {$1300.00} and let me withdraw that so I can close my account and go elsewhere. This is infuritating!! I 've been a customer for 7 years.	1
then said a XXXX party	1
then said our XX/XX/XXXX payment was returned for ins. funds-our bank statements shows it cleared. XX/XX/XXXX they sent a notice of default with intent to accelerate	1
then scam you by counting a denial as actually receiving a report	1
then send in my proof of cancelled checks to verify as my proof. They 'd call me at work and harass me until early in XXXX when I told them to stop. I 'd get notices on my door to call every week. Finally in XX/XX/XXXX	1
then sends letters that they are starting foreclosing process on certain dates because my payment is late. I would like to refinance to get away from this company	1
then sent a XXXX form ( contradicting their phone statement & continued to send "" Statements '' ( using the corrected address I had provided ) until XXXX XXXX in Sen. XXXX 's Office contacted them. They called to assure me that they knew that the account was fraudulent but refused to provide evidence of how it was opened or where alleged bank deposits were sent. Despite this assurance	1
then sent a XXXX form ( contradicting their phone statement & continued to send "" Statements '' ( using the corrected address I had provided ) until XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX Office contacted them. They called to assure me that they knew that the account was fraudulent but refused to provide evidence of how it was opened or where alleged bank deposits were sent. Despite this assurance	1
then sent them the money in time-yet Santander refused to send the title to XXXX XXXX saying more money was owed due to the bankruptcy. ) XXXX XXXX called requesting a written pay off and so did I several times and Santander refused. I even requested as the customer to fax it to me and they refused. I would call back and ask to speak to a supervisor and either be told none were available	1
then she gave me a number XXXX to "" XXXX XXXX	1
then sold it to a investor who buys nonperforming loans.Wells Fargo was paid in full for my loan and now trying to auction my home off. Will cause my XXXX	1
then sold to Nations Star Mortgage	1
then sold to Vericrest and I had to start the modification process over again and then sold to Caliber over a one year period. Caliber ignored my attempts and cont. to harass me by stating they did not have correct documentation	1
then sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
then stopped paying altogether in XXXX. He and I went to court so I could simply request the property be listed for sale and he objected ( while not paying mortgage and I paid rent somewhere else ) so we went to the XXXX Superior Court	1
then telling me it came back verified. Why are XXXX and XXXX able to do manual investigations and Experian not? They are clearly not investigating using the information I have provided and match these accounts with my name only	1
then that is attempted extortion. If you attempt to force me to do business with you without any written relationship between us	1
then that is what I would 've done a year ago. This modification process needs to be examined. I have been sent letters from Wells Fargo attorneys stating that Wells Fargo has started foreclosure proceedings	1
then the RECALULATE the remaining principal and interest to maintain the original maturity date and require the next month 's payment in full. Their business practice end up making the loan appear younger and they end up collecting more interest than standard industry practices	1
then the company tells me that Experian must do the same	1
then the following month	3
then the principal amount from my regular payment	1
then there should be some sort of repercussions for Lenderlive 's late tax payment and poor record keeping. The increased payment is not the issue. I understand why it 's happening. The issue is that I 'm held to XXXX standard and Lenderlive can apparently do whatever they please.	1
then they acknowledged that the payments were made and indicated there was a problem with there system and they were migrating to a new system. By XX/XX/XXXX they could not give me a concete amount as to what my trial payment was or my permanently modified payment. One month I paid XXXX and then the next month I was told to pay XXXX There was no rhyme reason to the whole process. I have still tendering payments to Ocwen every month.	1
then they asked for a letter from the landlord	1
then they attempt to reach me on my cell phone from an unlisted number throughout the day	1
then they called my cell phone the next day leaving me a voice message that if I do n't take care of this matter today	1
then they modify and resign at another date and tell you that you owe them money. I was upset and I told them I am sorry I can not pay money for something I did not ask for. Two years later I look at my credit report and there it is. This is unfair and unjust. I have went on social media to post a negative review to warn other potential victims	1
then they put me through a second trial. Hopes of getting a modification. The payment went for {$710.00} ( 3 ) month	1
then they retracted it. not sure what to believe. XXXX XXXX XXXX never sent a bill or made any calls to me. I received invoiced from XXXX other providers that saw me at the same hospital visits and I paid them all upon receipt. I believe XXXX XXXX XXXX violated fair debt collection act by sending me to collection without sending me an invoice or attempt to contact me and let me know that I have an invoice from him. Why other providers invoices were received and his invoice was not	1
then they send me a bill for XXXX early cancellation plus the overtime.	1
then they should have the records! They are charging over {$200.00} of interest	1
then they should include that check in the opening process. They had my SSN	1
then they started using another number	1
then they tell me their executive department will get back to me and that never happened. I 'm at a loss of what to do. No one at either Ebay or paypal seems to know what the real issue is or why their own gift cards will not work ... At one point they even sent me to Ebay XXXX? I do n't live in XXXX I live in the U.S. It would be one thing if they could tell me the issue and give me options	1
then they walk away. NetSpend is violating consumer laws by not providing disclosures to customers	1
then they were willing to back out. What a rip off. So now	1
then to Chase Bank and now to XXXX. Due to financial hardship I tried to do agreement to return the property after trying multiple times to Refinance the loans which have a very high interest rate	1
then to XXXX and use XXXX XXXX. I believe that this is elder financial abuse in that GM Financial took the car when the equity was nearly complete thereby nearly XXXX their income from the loan if it were remarketed.	1
then transferred to ditech. I started to questions the validation of debt and green tree or Ditech has yet to validate the debt. My understanding my deceased husbands estate XXXX out the balance of the mortgage when he passed away and information was provided to green tree and ditech. Public Policy and Alabama Law as a widow and heirs we have rights. The are continuing to report on my credit report now stating I had a mortgage with them XXXX/XXXX/XXXX this is a complete lie. I never had a mortgage with GreenTree or Ditech or signed a contract with them XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. to make it clear I signed a note with XXXX and I have documents of this. XXXX has released the lien and satisfaction of mortgage. Ditech has changed to Ditech LLc a debt collector and continues to report on my credit report and will not XXXX out the balance. I do ask them to credit my account. I have asked many time to see both sides of the books and a complete audit and they refuse. I hate to have to sue I will receive a large sum for all the fraud this company has done. Nor did I ever authorize this company to have my personal information. I have my common law copyright and trade mark on file in the county I live and sent a copy to Green tree. They have ignored me.	1
then tried to bully us into paying for a rate lock extension. XXXX many times threatened us by stating we did n't deserve good customer service and he could charge us what he chose to extend the rate. We had to ask for the GFE paperwork XXXX times until it was finally emailed.	1
then updated my acct while in dispute as well as never sending me anything in writing. They have never properly investigated my disputes and have continued to report false information causing my credit scores to go down tremendously. Resurgent ( aka LVNV ) buys alleged debt AFTER it has been charged off	1
then was told it was sent on XXXX	1
then we do n't hear from them until the next month. This is getting really annoying and I am afraid that they are at some point going to report this to the credit companies. ( The also did not respond to our flood insurance on a timely basis which made our premium increase. This has since been corrected through a call I made to my insurance agent. )	1
then we were transferred to GMAC	1
then were informed by AHMSI that we were denied ( after being approved	1
then what recourse does the customer have?	1
then when i call eagle finance im told to call glennon law firm.its noting but a bunch of run around hassle.	1
then when we would provide the proof	1
then who did it? Are they asking me to believe that someone else came to my house	1
then why	1
then why does n't it reflect on my statement. There are no parentheses showing that my account was in the negative at any given time. Anytime your account is in the negative	1
then will re-adjust the payment to include principal and interest. We also have a balloon payment due of {$26000.00}	1
then wired too. Everything was happen at XXXX XXXX and XXXX 2015. All details for these wire transactions included with printed statements. Chase told me	1
then would retract the liability and close the file. Morgan Stanley has consistently refused for months and months now to revise the forms. Eventually XXXX withheld funds from our XXXX tax refund to satisfy the improperly assessed liability. So Morgan Stanley has cost us {$10000.00}! And not to mention continuing frustration	1
then you should also track and allow a customer to specify how payments are applied. Bestbuy is trying to force collecting interest.	1
then {$130.00}	1
there 's a hard pull. And he said he need my more info	1
there 's a sticker to call to activate it	1
there 's other problems. In XXXX XXXX I sent a QWR ( Qualified Written Request ) to Citi addressing many concerns & questions about the account. I 'cc ' the name of husbands Chap XXXX attorney in the QWR. Citi sends half-assed response to him. Those concerns they choose to ignore is going to cost us our home. & gt ; I believe there has been a slow	1
there 's something wrong with you. '' I guess they do n't do it mathematically. I think their system had not updated yet	1
there ARE TOO MANY ILLEGAL VIOLATION 'S	1
there are Xs on these accounts as the XXXX last digits of each account is hidden. I previously called a CAPITAL ONE specialist regarding this issue and he informed that there was nothing to worry about	1
there are beneficiaries listed on my bank accounts and The Money Store demanded that I obtain a letter from the bank stating my beneficiaries can not withdraw any money from the account. Once I submitted that bank letter	1
there are constantly people who visit my property in the day while my XXXX children are home taking pictures	1
there are no options. I do not understand how this company rather get paid zero than try and work something out so they can get paid something. People at this point have nothing to lose by not paying their loans. We have no property and our credit scores are shot either way! I feel that access group/XXXX do not care about the millions of people that want to pay	1
there are no terms or conditions	1
there are payments scheduled for each account to bring them all current. My bank returned payments	1
there are so many XXXX angry customers posting about not receiving their direct deposit since last week.	1
there balance had indeed accrued another {$0.00} in interest on XXXX/XXXX/15. That same day I spoke to XXXX at First Niagara who attempted to credit my account the {$0.00} retroactive to the original balance date of XXXX/XXXX/15 which she had done. She also advised that XXXX once again provided me with misleading information in that the balance was still accruing interest. She said that she would freeze the account so that it would no longer accrue interest since it was "" clear I was attempting to pay off the card. '' I also paid an additional {$0.00} towards the balance that day in an attempt to pay off the balance once and for all. XXXX my payment and XXXX 's {$0.00} credit went thru and my balance was down to {$0.00} on XXXX/XXXX/15. However	1
there has never been an escrow on my home which I have owned for 11 years now. How do I get the fraudulent amount removed from my account? I have proof that all property taxes have been paid via my personal bank accounts - I have receipts and cancelled checks	1
there have been a few times that I had the money when I authorized Synchrony Bank to take my payment but they waited so long that by the time they withdrew my money	1
there have been delays in direct deposits from the financial aid disbursements. However	1
there have been several charges made to the account that were not made clear to me upon opening the account. I have been very dissatisfied not only with the lack of clarity in there communication	1
there is a "" comma '' after the number {$2.00} in the dollar amount of the check which makes it look like a {$3.00}. It is my understanding that checks are to be paid by using the hand written amount instead of the dollar amount written on the check. The hand written amount states "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX cents ''. So what is this "" machine '' that reads the dollar amount of the check instead of the handwritten amount and are consumers aware of this practice?	1
there is a 6	1
there is a back-and-forth conversation with NVR Mortgage Finance in regard to deferring my student loan. I told them in the beginning of this process and repeatedly thereafter that XXXX	1
there is a pending transaction in process.	1
there is a recorded message saying to leave my name	1
there is a scheduled foreclosure sale on my home for XXXX/XXXX/XXXX.	1
there is absolutely no means to inquire about the info or file a dispute.	1
there is almost no way to postpone payments without defaulting	1
there is also no documentation of the automatic payment made on the fraudulent charge except on my bank statement. I am beyond disgusted that they have continued to deny me my basic rights to my account and have continued to hold my money hostage under the circumstance.	1
there is another credit card that been inactive since XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
there is approx. {$30000.00} of equity in his home that I believe CitiFinancial is trying to cash in on. I certainly think that if they were n't	1
there is know contact phone number to communicate with them on a regulat basis. Also	1
there is no "" principal only '' option	1
there is no "" utilization '' factor. There is simply an unpaid debt.	1
there is no choice for the topic of my inquiry	1
there is no debt validation	1
there is no governing body to enforce a bankruptcy filing with them.	1
there is no judical signature	1
there is no legal justification to hold my money for this amount of time either	1
there is no money was transferred from NBA to my mortgage company called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. My due date is XXXX/XXXX/2015. Please help! Please let me know which documents need to be provided.	1
there is no reason the consumer should not have it in his or her hands the same day	1
there is no way i can afford an attorney.	2
there is no way to actually pay our new mortgage payment - a payment which has been paid on time since inception. STAY AWAY FROM NYCB XXXX	1
there is no way to communicate with Ocwen. I had submitted questions via their website months ago about another situation with no response to date. Try to contact them without using the cushy channel they 've set up to pretend the are working with consumers on financial matters in good faith. Please try so you can see what likely many are experiencing. Very difficult to interact with Ocwen and time marches on while the roofing contractor has completed the work and is waiting to be paid. Why no call from the stateside team as they told me I 'd receive? Why no email address to interact with Ocwen? I replied to their message ask for information on "" Private Repair Guidelines '' as that is relevant for some work in scope. The email bounced as undeliverable. Or do n't contact us	1
there is no way to contact them to stop the payment.	1
there is not flag and I can not re-dispute unless I upload a document	1
there is nothing I can see in their fine print saying that.	1
there is nothing on my credit report about this debt either ... .and why? cause its paid off. This was settled all that time ago	1
there is now unpaid interest and late fees on my account.	1
there is outgoing payments box.	1
there is still more and more charges occuring. Luckily	1
there is still {$3000.00} in payments sitting in a suspense account because although Ocwen refused to extend to me the permanent modification	1
there office of the president refered me to there consumer advocate which was suppose to handle the concern but it conducted themselves in the same manner which caused the unnecessary foreclosure due to there neligence. I would appreciate for your supervisor to look at previous documents and documents which I will enclose in the mail with file number	1
there reply had nothing to do with the complaint. Contacted the Omnibudsman with no reply.	1
there response that was this information was verified	2
there violation my rights under the FCRA and FCBA	1
there was NO reduction of the 6.375 % interest rate	1
there was a collection item on my XXXX report. The same collection item was reported on my XXXX report but they have since deleted it. XXXX refuses to delete saying that Southwest Credit System Account number XXXX has been verified as reported by the data furnisher. I have repeatedly contacted Southwest Credit Systems and they refer me over to XXXX ( who held the original debt ). The only thing I 've been able to establish to prove this account is not mine is that it was apparently tied to an address I lived at over 30 years ago with my ex-wife. From the XXXX through XXXX I lived in XXXX	1
there was a compliant file against me and to call XXXX and reference # XXXX before further action it taken against me. XXXX XXXX then called me at work and identified himself only as XXXX XXXX and tried to obtain personal information about. I asked if he was a debt collector and not to call me at work. He replied "" Yes '' and "" Why? ' I explained I could be terminated and XXXX XXXX proceeded to collect on the debt after he was given this information. XXXX XXXX actions are harassing and believe this collector/agency has violated FDCPA regulations.	1
there was a difference of XXXX payment missing from the beginning. After deciding that an attorney would not get a case for around {$150000.00}	1
there was a flood	1
there was a rebill on XXXX for the {$91.00}. I have sent them a letter on XXXX explaining in detail the issue again and have yet to see this reversed.	1
there was a resolution. The would in fact lay my {$2400.00} tax bill from my escrow account and they would charge me {$66.00} in interest because I was not an escrow consumer and	1
there was a transaction rebill for that {$74.00} which Capital One stated it was XXXX. The guys at Capital One informed me he would dispute that and make sure it did not appear again	1
there was a {$60000.00}	1
there was an amount of {$430.00} for fees with no determination or detail of how these fees were determined.	1
there was an offer and it was denied which forced a foreclosure to the home. It 's very hard to move forward with your credit in a disarray. Any help or direction you can provide for my family will greatly be appreciated.	1
there was an unauthorized inquiry conducted by company.	1
there was n't a NSF credit due to trying to process a payment from XXXX XXXX. Finally	1
there was never an option to change it to the "" Send money to friends or family '' which normally results in a free transfer. Nowhere in the process was the fact that a fee would be charged disclosed.	1
there was no cash to close required	1
there was no mention of what our new monthly payment should be. SLS is holding the funds until the total equals a full payment which I found out is {$450.00} per month. If XXXX would have told me what my new payment was in XX/XX/XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX I would have paid it. We are in the process of trying to refinance our home and SLS is considering those payment sent in XX/XX/XXXX	1
there was no mention of who that issuer was. I telephoned that number and the prompt said that my application for a credit card was denied because of too little credit. I then got someone on the phone from Maryland who would not identify themselves with any company and told me I would have to take it up with XXXX. The prompt controverted what the receipt said	1
there was no particular deadline or timeframe on their lot loans for building which represented the most flexible plan I had seen so it enticed me to choose XXXX as my lender. Sometime in XXXX	1
there was no time to find a remedy to the solution	1
there was no way for me to know that the loan transfered to another collection agency.	1
there was nothing I could do. So all the paperwork I supplied them	1
there was nothing he can do. He did not have authority to remove off my credit since it was already reported. I asked if there was anyone else to speak with	1
there was nothing negative in the entire report dating back many years. BoA subsequently reinstated my line of credit.	1
there was nothing she could do becasue they were already reported to the credit buerea.She then asked a supervisor to see if the {$200.00} fees could be refunded.She came back and advised her supervisor XXXX said no.Asked to speak to XXXX.Informed Operations Manager XXXX that I was not adivsed that I had to pay for the loans and I did not recieve any statements or bills.Asked him if the statements were sent to XXXX XXXX.He indicated yes	1
there were XXXX big thunderstorms in form of a tornado with strong heavy rain. My basement got flooded twice. And I had to repair the damages and unfortunately I had to use the money I had to make the repairs I had no other options but to fix it. I tried making a insurance claim but I did not got a proved I had a claim in my file and making a new claim would probably increase my insurance policy or the insurance would have close my relationship with then for having more claims. I contacted ( fema ) and they denied me any type of funds. I had no other alternatives. Now I regret it because maybe I took a wrong decision. If these nature disasters would had happen I would be current at this moment. I regret it but now it 's too late. I explained my situation many times to nationstar mortgage but they did n't seem to consider what had happen. They did n't seem to care and denied me any type of assistance when I know that this nature disasters caused me to fall behind on my mortgage. All I want is a second chance I want to keep my home and start making my payments as soon as possible. I know together we can make it happen I want to keep my home and together we can find a solution to this matter. I 've done everything in my hands to get a loan elsewhere but I would not qualify since I 'm behind my mortgage it 's not easy to get a new loan to pay off your past due amount. I tried many companies but I do n't get good hopes since I 'm behind so I would not qualify automatically. I do n't know what else to do so that nationstar mortgage give me a solution to this matter all I want is to keep home and start making my payments asap. I 've done so many appeals and I still get denied. It does n't matter what i do anymore	1
there were XXXX different "" loans '' with this call	1
there were adequate funds to have them paid by the due date. The loan was sold 3x	1
there were glaring inconsistencies in how the money was being allocated across my various loans	1
there were hundreds of dollars that would not have been charged with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The lender had required that we use Titan Title in XXXX	1
there were no additional savings to me. More money was coming out of my account than necessary. Now	1
there were no incorrect pin attempts and the transactions were done in the city I work. I told them this was not acceptable	1
there were numerous correspondences only for the big let down	1
there would NOT have been any charges assessed to the account.	1
there would be no additional action. At that time	1
thereby adversely affecting my credit. In addition	1
thereby deeming my XXXX payment as unpaid. I find it to be very unfair that I 'm being harassed	1
thereby making my payment 30 days late ( unless I pay a {$15.00} fee ).	1
thereby placing the borrower at an excessive risk of default or foreclosure.	1
thereby preventing me from lowering my monthly payments as I desire to do. This has gone on over three months now. Please let me know how I can get better service from this lender. I wish my loan had never been sold to them. I chose a local lender in the first place to prevent this kind of problem.	1
thereby prohibiting them from reporting anything related to	2
therefore	9
therefore ; charging a total of {$140.00} in overdraft fees. Their explanation is that their practice is to pay out the largest items XXXX so that mortgages	1
therefore ; the average client will be left with more than a few costly overdraft fees. Every time I have called to complain about how my available balance changes from day to day	1
therefore I am only able to make the payments by the end of the month and keep in mind	1
therefore I could never move forward in paying off the loan. Due to the economic hardships I was forced to place my loans in deferment and/or forbearance in order to afford the other bills and living costs I had. In it 's current state I still pay more per month for my loans than I do my home loan	1
therefore I make this request to immediately remove this inquiries that appears in my report and that affects my score negatively	1
therefore I totally dispute the issue and request XXXX to refund my money I have n't used their service during the period above and I deport my line and my family lines due to their net work problem. thanks and best regards XXXX XXXX	1
therefore also re-aging my account with them. I contacted XXXX back in XXXX of XXXX and requested all my original loan documentation from them ( promissary note	1
therefore any new fees or interest rates that have changed	1
therefore causing me problems in getting a place to live. I want to pay the debt and have this removed from my credit so I can finally get a home/apartment. I already filed a complaint with the Attorney General and my issue was not resolved. The company will not send me a letter via mail regarding settlement amount etc	1
therefore having a delinquency on my credit report is NOT an accurate representation of my credit. Now	1
therefore my mortgage payment should not have increased. What they are doing is illegal and violates RESPA. They have failed to resolve this matter or give me a reasonable explanation why they are continuing to charge me this increased erroneous amount.	1
therefore the amount showing as of today is incorrect and under FCRA this should be removed. This is the second time within a 30 day period this has happened. I have until XX/XX/XXXX to show cause as why I would like to proceed in continuing sue Equifax. This will be a reason why.	1
therefore they are in violation of the fair credit reporting act	1
therefore they should not have been able to sell the car to me in the first place. Company is in current Lawsuits to recover the deposits paid on the cars they sold. Lobel approved a loan of a car whose license was suspended by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
these XXXX ENTITIES continue to violated my consumer protection rights pursuant Fair Debt Collections Practices Act ( FDCPA ) and Truth in Lending ( TILA ). See enclosed Notice of Default served to me by XXXX XXXX.	1
these accounts are being reported to all three credit bureaus without providing validity of this debt to me. This is harmful to my credit scores. Not to mention	1
these are the types of issues that our American veterans have to combat in order to try to even maintain some sort of normal life	1
these calls keep coming and i believe are a personal vendetta.	1
these circumstances made it difficult for us to maintain a mortgage payment of XXXX. Last XXXX XXXX offered us a modification trial which brought our payment down to XXXX we have had no problem making this payment. and made XXXX in a row. After we made our XXXX payment to XXXX	1
these criminal bankers continued to plunder my bank accounts anyway	1
these dept collection agencies keep adding the same debts on my credit reports. It wastes me a lot of time and frustration to file the disputes with XXXX agencies every month. These collection agencies keep call me every month	1
these disputed items must be reinvestigated or deleted from my credit record within 30 days.	1
these documents have been submitted via their fax line and emailed to womomever the current file owner is at the time. The documents are confirmed to have been received however a week or two passes and they ask for the same documents over again. This file has been escilated to the executive offices at Wells Fargo and they then reassign the file and the process of submitting the same documents over and over begins again.	1
these monies were applied to my study XXXX trip. I was later toldby the financial aid office at XXXX three months before my XX/XX/XXXX completion date that the grant to the amount of {$5500.00} was reapplied to my XX/XX/XXXX XXXX semester without knowledge. I never signed or made any written or verbal agreement with XXXX College	1
these negative marks should be removed from all XXXX credit bureaus.	1
these people claim to have the Debt from XXXX	1
they	1
they "" short-changed '' me considerably in comparison to others. And if you read their terms for new cardholders	1
they 'll either report this debt as included in bankruptcy and remove any negative information or will delete it entirely from credit reports.	1
they 're saying I owe them money & if I do n't pay them {$25.00}	1
they 're telling me they wo n't remove the unpaid difference from my credit report. I 've asked for a letter from GM that states the account was settled for $ XXXX with a {$0.00} balance due	1
they 've reported a new late payment on my credit report	1
they ( the company ) has proceeded to harass my mother and ask her who will pay this money to them. They have also told her in detail what my debt is. I asked my mother what she told them and she has said that I do n't live with her. She did not inquire about how much I owe but was told my personal information anyway. I believe this practice is very unprofessional	2
they 1st hide the fund seeing I would not drop it. They stated on my "" Statement '' {$1700.00} paid in for credit? was for taxes. Then I thought was fixed they got the OK to sell to BSI in XX/XX/XXXX	1
they STILL assessed an additional interest fee. they agreed to close the acocunt. I am receiving this treatment as a direct result of my being XXXX address	1
they STILL have not fixed the problems they created and they compound their errors by dunning me with inappropriate late fees and interest charges on this closed and fully paid account	1
they WOULD remove the language/codes but it would n't be reported correctly until XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX ... re-applied for mortgage - dispute language/comments/codes still on credit report. I proceeded to call FOX Collections AGAIN- they were very rude - claimed now that they did n't say they would remove the dispute language OR that they received my email requesting the accounts to no longer be in dispute ( again	1
they XXXX show I paid two payments of {$250.00} which left a {$0.00} balance on the accts paid to XXXX XXXX XXXX. When I explained to the rep at Equifax that the item for {$200.00} to the same company XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
they XXXX were reporting a balance when they were XXXX XXXX	1
they acknowledge that my auth is in. This time I am attaching my conversation log notes so you can see that I spoke to them on XXXX	1
they added a monthly charge of {$4.00} for internet modem	1
they admit to "" some mistakes were made '' but that is not good enough for me. I would like to see that the banking industry do more to protect this vulnerable population. I would like to see that steps be put into place that when a family member calls to alert any bank that they suspect their family members are being scammed	1
they admitted that hey do not have me in their files nor can they find me. When I disputed their false charges again through Transunion	1
they advised me they do not refund mortgage companies for issues such as this. They said the mortgage company has to request the funds from the owner of the property that they erroneously paid. Nationstar is now saying they did not make a mistake. My attorney has documentation showing the issue and that I am being penalized for this	1
they advised they would be in touch but no one ever returned a call. My family had arranged this with their mortgage companies and no one had issues. I started receiving notices that I was late or not making a payment. I have never been late since then. I have been sending them letters	1
they again took money from my credit union account when I had a XXXX credit. I contacted them again and requested that they replace the money into my credit union account and they said they were unable to do that. I will be contacting my credit union today to request that USAA no longer be able to withdraw funds from my account.	1
they agree that the fax number and loan number we are using in our multiple faxes containing the 'missing ' acknowledgement form are correct. They refuse to give an email or other method for delivery. They also returned XXXX of the small insurance checks to us	1
they agreed that my loan was eligible for the forgiveness after numerous followup phone calls and that my loan forgiveness would be processed by XXXX XXXX and that there was nothing they could do to expedite the processing. I called back to get help from another department that works with the Department of Justice and was told my loan was set to be processed by XXXX XXXX. Now it is the end of XXXX and they are telling me that ca n't give me a date it will be processed. I have been mislead and lied to by several Bank of America staff members and due to their processing delay the buyers of my home are threatening a potential law suit and the sellers of the home we are buying are threatening to cancel the sale if this issue does n't get resolved quickly. The delay	1
they agreed this was their mistake and each time they told me I could fill out a loan modification packet to get my account current again after i kept complaining that the payment was not what I agreed upon. Now for the past year I have been filling out loan modification paperwork maybe four our five times ( different packets ). Each time I am told I missed the deadline. I even had it certified mail and the packet was there on time	1
they agreed to remove it ( again ). After the loan was paid off	1
they all know where I live including Equifax. BUT to really prove how the violated my rights	1
they all stated I have a two year window in which to report fraudulent activity and they refuse to honor their own verbal and written agreement. Additionally	1
they allowed many charges to go through even after my credit limit was exceeded. I showed over XXXX charges at the same XXXX. That should have been another reason for them to close the account down until they could talk to me even if I had never contacted them.Why would Citibank allow any new charges on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/2015 to go through after I just informed that I lost my wallet and cell phone. So now I have over XXXX fraudulent charges on my account from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Not once did Citibank do anything to prevent this from happening. Citibank is completely unbelievable. I just cant believe this even as I write this message.	1
they already have the deed of trust	1
they also assessed a late fee for another dollar and some change. They were calling me because I now owed them {$2.00}. They explained that they talked to my aunt and she had paid it	1
they also claim not to have received any e communications from me even though i have the saved email resonse in my email account. now they have locked my credit account so i ca n't view my bill online??? totally disablied it but they now send me emails to log in??? I know now what the red target means	1
they also granted & ETF a loan for {$1000.00} at a 200 % interest rate	1
they also have free access to our credit reports from XXXX and XXXX and with that they have ALL the information needed to pass any kind of security or verification questions to get more reports	1
they also put me in a potentially harmful financial position. If I did not have the ability to pay the card down by the next billing cycle	1
they also state that this debt is too old to be sued on. To use the word "" settle '' implies that they are going to sue me. This debt has passed the statute of limitations and to me this is a violation of the FDCPA to threaten to sue me an an old debt.	1
they always receive payment EVERY MONTH. It is a constant battle and I feel harassed and exhausted every time I deal with them. Yesterday	1
they apologetically let me know that there was nothing they were able to do. I called the credit card company and asked why the debt was still there if I paid the settlement	1
they apologized for what they felt should be illegal and told me to call an attorney ASAP! When I contacted the 'zombie company	1
they appear to be the same company using the tactic of reporting the same collection to various credit reporting agencies but using different names in an attempt to damage my credit and coerce me to pay for a debt that I do not owe. I have never received bills from the said companies and I have no idea what the nature of the collection may be.	1
they appraised the land ( purchased for {$120000.00} ) at {$9800.00} ( tax appraisal uninproved is {$70000.00} ). To do that they found land XXXX miles away selling for $ XXXX/acre and ignored land pricing anywhere closer much less inside the resort community. They chose XXXX comparable	1
they are XXXX of XXXX companies that is doing this to me.	1
they are a known-seedy	1
they are able to collect XXXX NSF fees at {$35.00} totaling {$100.00}. If the posted the itmes from smallest to largest	1
they are affecting my credit score	1
they are also charging me a ridiculously high repossession fee of {$400.00}. They are letting me know that if the {$1200.00} is not payed within 10 days	1
they are also taking from an account that was designed to protect the finances of a person unable to manage their own	1
they are asking me for the XXXX time in two years to yet again provide documents only because they claim to not receive. I feel discriminated against	1
they are basically trying yo steal it from me. They have made me complete at min	1
they are calling non-stop. They have even went as far as calling my family members on their jobs. They work at the XXXX and they are not allowed to receive such calls. They ( Ally Bank XXXX are calling and asking them their names and if they know me. They have been harassing me and all family member for a number of weeks. I am not working and I ca n't pay them or anyone else. They start calling in the morning and they do n't stop until XXXX	1
they are causing more issues with my bank account which was to be closed and was n't by the bank themselves.	1
they are charging interest and penalties on the loan that was paid. For 6 months we have been trying to work with the bank to get an accurate balance. We have had a lender that was willing to pay off the loan but BSI has been unable to get the payoff amount or balance due in 6 months. They are also continually reporting the loan incorrectly to the credit bureaus since they have not applied payments correctly. we have had a few discussions with our representatives and they always say they are working on it. Recently we have had update calls scheduled but they do not call. The person at BSI who says he is going to resolve the issues is XXXX XXXX. I believe the loan is now paid off	1
they are confirming your information. Once you "" update '' your information	1
they are continuing to report.	1
they are continuously reporting my payment as late and despite multiple disputes via XXXX and XXXX and talking to One Main directly	1
they are demanding that the insurance is escrowed. I object to that change ( not to maintaining the XXXX policy ) and have been told they can not "" separate '' the insurance from the taxes in escrow.	1
they are derogatory and insulting in how they speak. Between all these calls they are harassing me at work and at home. Ive called and spoke to the manager as well. Ive set a date to pay this in full	1
they are dodging the issue. We sent our XX/XX/XXXX payment in to them and they are holding it and not applying it to our account so we will be behind in our payments. We feel like we are being taken advantage of!	1
they are doing everything they can to prevent me from refinancing and leaving their company. It started with them claiming payments were never received	1
they are failing miserably.	1
they are failing to report a tax lien that was released as released it just shows no status. I have also noticed that the reports that they send you is different then what credit monitoring services have on file as your report. I intend to start litigation against Equifax for this bold and malicious behavior if not corrected asap.	1
they are falsely implying that transactions with that merchant will receive the 5 % bonus ( despite the fine print that they ca n't guarantee a purchase will qualify for 5 % rebates ). US Bank has not done their due diligence to verify that their list of example merchants is accurate and as a result is deceiving their customers. This deception affected my purchasing decision. I would not have made this purchase without the promise of 5 % cash back and as a result have been injured in the amount of {$79.00} in lost rewards.	1
they are garbage that should be in prison.	1
they are groups of people who is hoodwink people bank account and they used me to do it. many days ago thought that the situation was closed	1
they are ignoring my phone calls	1
they are in direct violation of Harrasement # XXXX XXXX Paragraphs XXXX & XXXX they are attempting to collect a debt ( credit Card ) that is XXXX years old since XXXX	1
they are intentionally trying to make us late on payment by not sending us our invoice in time. I have been paying ahead of the invoice because I never receive it in time to prevent late payment which is a HUGE XXXX BUSINESS TACTIC. Even though I sent my payment ahead of invoice receipt last month	1
they are made to jump through so many hoops	1
they are not a helpful and thread me to mess my credit report and keep messing my credit report till I paid them so I write them a letter requesting VALIDATION of debt	1
they are not affiliated ) misrepresenting themselves in order to try and collect a debt. I felt threatened	1
they are not going to send me a sandwich. In essence	1
they are not posting to correct date to account for lost interest. Every time I call they give my run around claiming it is posted correctly to the XXXX date. However there is no such documentation. Even when I check online. Most recently they reversed my $ XXXX payment and applied to XXXX making my principle increase. I have called multiple times and get told something. There is no one from finance dept that costumer service can turn to. On multiple time I was told I would receive call but did not. In summary	1
they are not proactive in updating me at all - I believe the file is sitting on someone 's desk until prompted to work on it. They had not asked me for XXXX additional piece of information	1
they are not reporting any payment amounts.Transunion is basically turning the other cheek on this. There are laws which indicate that if a payment is reported then the payment amount should also be recorded. Child Support is smart enough to know that if they record me as making payments then it could possibly remain longer. Why are n't the payment amounts being listed. This is unjust and something must be done. I would like for Transunion to remove this account from my credit report for once and for all.	1
they are not very good at doing that. Consistently	1
they are now harassing by phone & any way they can with reps & auto dialers. They are interfering with my ability to make progress and harassing me at work. I had no contact or communication with a rep named XXXX XXXX	1
they are now stating that my PMI will be terminated XX/XX/XXXX!! XX/XX/XXXX I will reach 62 % of my LTV ratio.	1
they are only evaluating my requests for reinstatement	1
they are our current VA Mortgage servicer	1
they are placing a hold on all of the other checks that were deposited including the cashiers ' check. When I asked why they did n't use the cashiers check first they could n't answer and stated that they have a hold on these funds. Were they to use the cashiers check first	1
they are predatory lenders. To date	1
they are quick to take your money but make it extremely difficult ( in my case	1
they are refusing my credit or permit	1
they are reporting information that is over seven years old	1
they are reporting it as derogatory included in a bankruptcy ( which is untrue ) It opened in XXXX 2013 and is current NEVER past due and has a current balance of approx. XXXX He got off the phone put me on hold and told me It was MY responsibility to get it corrected	1
they are reporting that I only have XXXX negative account and no positive accounts. They claim I opened the account on XX/XX/2013 and the amount was for XXXX for a term of XXXX month. How these agencies can not see the ridiculousness of this is beyond me	1
they are required to remove it. They did not. They chose only to update the account even though they had not received any verification showing its validity or accuracy. They refused to provide me with a copy of the letter they received from XXXX XXXX. I received no written results of investigation	1
they are requiring my signing of a formatted letter generated by Nationstar mortgage that states that I will be charged up to {$600.00} for an appraisal that they will acquire. Well	1
they are responsible for their agents. So when I call them tomorrow to ask them about their agent	2
they are ruining my life	1
they are saying they are exempt from the FDCPA and I have no recourse but to be harassed by them.	1
they are servicing the loan ). I endorsed all of the checks	1
they are sitting on {$15000.00} that i need to pay my contractor with. I have asked them to contact my insurance adjustor because clearly they are not listening to me and not able to read the adjustors report. I have sent them all the required documents and they still will not release my funds. How do I pay my contractor? I have sent in completion photos. I have sent in tax id numbers. They will not release my depreciated amount until an inspection is done. They will not do an inspection until i have all the work complete. Neither XXXX of my contractors will sign a lien waiver until they are paid in full. I cant afford to pay them without my insurance money. The mortgage company states that none of the funds can be released to me. If I end up paying the contractor they will not refund the money to me.	1
they are sorry. I was told that the original request should have been forwarded onto them and they were very sorry it was n't. I ca n't get a XXXX temp tag and have to wait for this to come through to get my metal tag. In the meantime	1
they are still investigating. '' Their official investigation was started XXXX XXXX. No other response has been given since	1
they are still planning to submit an ACH bank account withdrawl from me for {$2200.00}. This despite calling their fraud department twice to appeal and sending them further documentation	1
they are suppose to write off the balance. Grant and Weber are refusing stating this is not true. They want the money from me and that 's all they care about. I have proof my daughter was covered by insurance. I also tried to get help from XXXX and they were on the side of the debt collector	1
they are supposed to instruct Trustee to reconvey the house and eliminate all evidence of debt. We sent them a Request of Statement of account	1
they are supposed to request documentation to explain. They refuse and are telling us that they will only give an explanation if the homeowner requests in writing - this is not acceptable. We have a good offer and these buyers will not continue much longer. They have offered them a short sale wherein they will not waive the deficiency without a huge contribution. This couple is on XXXX and has NO MONEY.	1
they are telling me that I must travel 6 hours away to an actual XXXX XXXX to have my phone evaluated. None of this is in my Terms & Conditions. I feel that I was baited with this card benefit	1
they are telling me that they can not honor the original rate quoted and need to charge me the higher originally quoted. Their excuse is that they had to switch to XXXX XXXX from XXXX. At this point	1
they are telling us to get a "" transmittal form '' from our bank to prove again that this transaction did indeed happen. Unfortunately	1
they are threatening to charge me an excessive late fee ( 15 % of my payoff amount ) while refusing to accept any normal payment method ( ACH/Pay-by-phone	1
they are threatening to come after me - although I have never cosigned on anything for this person - it is getting ridiculous	1
they are threatening to send the account to a collection agency and they call and leave messages several times a day. I am XXXX years old	1
they are to stop calling our home or sending collection letters.	1
they are trying to do to remedy my issue.	1
they are trying to take my home from me.	1
they are unwilling to offer an extention for my standard payment.	1
they are woefully unable to do anything other than recite information you already have. Most recently	1
they ask me for a payment of {$3600.00} wich was send it to them on XXXX	1
they asked me to sign the statement "" If	1
they asked my credit card information and they said they need to charge for appraisal in advance by assuring me that there will not be any issue. Again	1
they asked them for more of ways to get in touch with me and I 'm not sure who else they call. XXXX from Ally denies this happened. Ally also told my friend they were calling other people too. She left her phone # and extension with my friend. Sadly and most frighteningly	1
they assured my agent	1
they auctioned off my home for XXXX when it is worth XXXX in current market. They left me with a XXXX mortgage that I am still responsible for. My lender is still paying the taxes and Insurance and charges all this to me every month.This firm is corrupt and has racketeering charges and convictions. They bribe as many people as they can and have taken over XXXX properties. We do not have XXXX for attorney fees to fight these cases. They take these homes and milk them for rents until the bank forecloses on me. They have taken the title out of my name and threatened to call the police if I step XXXX foot in my home.	1
they auctioned the car at wholesale and not retail	1
they began calling me before I could have possibly received the bill. When I told her that I was disputing the charges and to cease calling me in the future for payments	1
they began charging me a monthly inspection fee of {$10.00} even though no inspection was being done. Upon questioning this in writing	1
they began demanding payment in full. Including taking my XXXX tax refund. They have now began calling from the debt collector and I have asked for an attorney to assist me. I attempted contact a couple times via email	1
they began harrassing me at work	1
they began periodically contacting me again and the debt continues to be reported to the credit bureaus. Because they have documented ownership of the debt	1
they began servicing my XXXX mortgage at Greentree. In XXXX 2011	1
they blamed it on the lender. I see evidence of discrimination here and would like this investigated. I may also be pursing this issue legally with the Illinois Attorney General.	1
they blasted very loud and menancing music into the receiver. Another time	1
they bought my loan from XXXX. Ca n't wait to be done with them.	1
they breached the contract a year later when they neglected to see me. I tried explaining this to XXXX XXXX that owned the debt but they sued	1
they breached the contract a year later when they neglected to see me. I tried explaining this to care credit that owned the debt but they sued	1
they ca n't find the information we submitted and do n't know what 's going on. I make appointments with our Ocwen Home Retention Specialist	1
they call AGAIN! Please consider this as a formal complaint against Allied Interstate for harassment as they are calling my phone number for a person who is not associated with this number	1
they call him back to back everyday. It is illegal to call a person on their job so many times especially when you speaking with the person that tells you they will call you back. They put a repossession man on the truck and he logged into my facebook account and pretended to be my godson that is stationed oversees to get my address when they already have my address. Then he called my home and told me he was there to pick up the truck which he must not have been cause at the time I was out of town with my husband. He should have never called me that is total harassment .Then they called my sister	1
they call me on my work phone ( State agency )	1
they call me several times a week	2
they call my phone several times a day and the caller ID shows XXXX.They are harassing me.	1
they call my professional business office where I am a XXXX and have sessions with my clients. They have even came to my office	1
they called again XXXX/XXXX/16 morning and evening	1
they called and threatened me	1
they called at XXXX	1
they called me back and said they 'll settle on XXXX to close out my account. I angrily declined the request and suggested they accept XXXX based on the payments I 've made thus far. They refused my offer. As such	2
they called me to inform me that I had taken credit card from them since XXXX XXXX	1
they called my partner to say there was a debt owed by me	1
they called this loan a "" Traditional Modification ''	1
they cam to my house and posted a notice that they were going to change the locks and board up my doors even if I am inside. I do n't think this is legal and could my self and my pets life in danger.	1
they came back and asked for a XXXX for rental property because they wanted to know why we had a loss. What does that have to do with a lower rate? We did not submit it. Much later we got a survey request from WF asking us to be honest and tell them why we did not proceed with the application. I wrote the same to them and now more than a month later - Nothing from WF. What is the point of asking if nothing is being done or even said?	1
they came back to ma and told me that the information provide by the merchant was accurate. Then they reevaluated my credit and said they that my credit was now a XXXX from the intial XXXX+ they had given me when I first contacted them via XXXX. Today	1
they came back with a debt to income ratio that did n't work for them. They had me pay off my car for $ XXXX and a credit card for $ XXXX which I did to get the debt to income in line. Also	1
they came up with yet another issue for delaying the process. This issue was a credit check that was done by some other mortgage company at the time I was checking rates in early to mid XXXX	1
they can and will attach payment from that. She even went so far as to ask him if he would make the settlement payment for me. I have just been released from the hospital two days ago after suffering a XXXX XXXX on Sunday XXXX XXXX	1
they can collect the amount of all of the parcels. And yes they know this is in error and acknowledge that it is in error. That defies all logic.	1
they can contact XXXX XXXX directly at XXXX.	1
they can have someone within arms reach in a matter of hours. They also spoke on me owing the state of XXXX a huge sum of money	1
they can hold it for a day	1
they can not	1
they can not be considered frivolous. This is my last resort before I send an intent to sue. I am a victim of identity theft and these inquiries are the result of someone else using my information.	5
they can not give me a time frame for their response. The bill is due by XXXX/XXXX/2016. They refuse to give me a time frame to have this reviewed and resolved.	1
they can not locate the account.	1
they can not pick and choose as they see fit. Also the mentioned I did not comply with their request for documentation. I give them everything I had. They offered no help at all. I can not afford this big of a hit to my finances. Please advise my credit card company of proper protocol and ensure they help me. I need your help.	1
they can not tell me. XXXX rep told me today that my loan was transferred and closed yesterday XXXX XXXX and then when I called back to speak to an escalation agent and she said that my loan was transferred on XXXX XXXX and they would n't have been able to give me any information. Someone is lying. I spoke to several Chase representative since I received the letter in XXXX and have spoken to several Chase rep this week XXXX XXXX and XXXX to get information about my loan and they transferred me to XXXX who says they can not give me any info until XXXX XXXX because Chase has n't transferred all my information yet. My apt is being sold and my closing is on XXXX XXXX and I have a right to know what my pay off quote from Chase is.	1
they can set up their computers to reject future charges to a credit card that is expired. Obviously that 's what they do when they suspect a credit card has been stolen. But BofA is telling me its impossible to really close my account. Or they are telling me that "" closing my account '' does n't mean reject all future charges. This is crazy. It should not be impossible to close an account and request that all future billings to said closed account be rejected.	1
they changed payment history to reflect a charge off prior to bankruptcy which is untrue. Prior credit reports show that the accounts were not charge off prior to bankruptcy. The credits retroactively changed payment history to charge off after bankruptcy. The creditors who are engaging in these actions XXXX. For example	3
they changed the amount of monies that were being applied to the principle therefore extending the note by ten months. If you take the difference in the XXXX month of the note and apply that to the principle	1
they charge a late fee of {$40.00}. Usually I mail my payment the first week of the month to ensure at least 9-10 days for the payment to arrive to Central Mortgage Company. Oddly enough	1
they charge a {$290.00} set-up fee and a standard monthly service fee ( I 'm okay with their monthly service charge	1
they charged me a late fee instead. I sense a borderline fraudulent practice to profit from customers by fees.	1
they charged me for overdraft despite the money was there and available	1
they charged me for the interest for the "" late payment ' This payment was never late	1
they charged me {$3.00} for the privilege. The funds did not show up today	1
they charged off the loans and demanded payment in full. While they were threatening more legal action	1
they charged off this account in XX/XX/XXXX and this is damaging my credit. They are now demanding to settle this account for a steep lump sum of money	1
they charged over {$12000.00} on his XXXX XXXX XXXX card and another {$10000.00} at another institution. Both Citibank and XXXX XXXX XXXX refuse to accept the fact that he did not make any of the purchases and have released the case to Collection agencies to recover the funds. I 've documented all the transactions and we can not believe that after all the documentation	1
they chat for a while then she left	1
they claim I am not entitled to the credit. I am still waiting for an explaination of what I did wrong	1
they claim because of a large volume of loan applications and not enough staff to process the loans in a timely fashion. When the loans were being processed	1
they claimed that I did not qualify for the certificate since my spend had n't occurred in the period between the date when my annual fee hit ( which was in XX/XX/XXXX ) and the end of my cardmember year. I told them that I was told that the eligible period was in fact based on my card opening date	1
they claimed that my agents was n't responding in which it is a false statement my agent have made every effect to sell my home. NationStar claims that the only way I can be able to get approved for a short sale if I participate in an online auction. They auction my property on XXXX XXXX	1
they claimed that only new card holders were eligible for the reward points. I feel that the bank pulled a bait and switch on me by offering the points for upgrading the card with the increased fee	1
they claimed they did n't have any records of my fax	1
they clear my bank. I write checks and mail them for a paper trail	1
they closed his account. This was just very unexpected from USAA because I have been a loyal customer for over 20 years and they have always provided the best customer service. In this instance	1
they closed my account due to a bad check. I wrote them numerous letters	1
they closed out my loan application indicating that I could reapply at a later date. The next day	1
they come back and hit me with XXXX additional NSF charges on XXXX. Also in XXXX	1
they come up with another reason why they can not release our money to do our repairs. We complied with everything our insurance company needed including documenting and approving all contractors. Now Green Tree is saying that they can not approve our contractors? What right do they have to do this when we complied with all of the proposal requirement and contractor requirement from our insurance. Each time	1
they completely ignore anything they have been provided other than their paperwork you have filled out. There is no way I can afford a garnishment of 15 % if the information I provided was reviewed. I have sent my story to various government and social service agencies. I have sent my story to various government employees including senators. I have sent my information to various media outlets and have been contacted XXXX. I urge anyone else suffering from the burden XXXX mismanagement to write their own stories so attention may be paid to the fact that we are people with lives not just a number.	1
they confirm me the change of address and when I make a credit report update the old address appears again and every day I have to call and they tell me lies and I feel discriminated .They not fix my address and they made me split file from my credit report because they say this very long and then my new credit accounts do not report them because there is no space. That is not right	1
they confirmed that they had received it and now they started calling me again.	1
they contacted me immediately after it was closed. However	1
they continue to call from this auto-dialer. They have my cell phone number	1
they continue to call repeatedly.	1
they continue to do so. Today they notified myself	2
they continue to harass me with a robotic call every day at XXXX. Our situation has not changed - we are trying to refinance our house in order to pay off the HELOC.	1
they continue to report	1
they continue to send emails stating pay now or your credit rating will be affected or place calls to my contact number on Saturdays and Sundays when their office is closed ( business hours are XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX Monday through Friday EST	1
they continue to verify this information with XXXX but not with me.	1
they continued to ask for information they already received	1
they continued to call another 7 times and call our references again. They were advised to pick up the vehicle and a cease and desist letter was sent via email and postal mail as well as verbally spoken. They have ignored our requests to refrain from calling references over the past 2 years and continued to do so over and over. They have ignored our requests to stop calling our phones over and over every day. They have ignored the email authorization agreement that was in place since XX/XX/XXXX so we can avoid all the phone calls. They have ignored all the emails we would send to update them on payments etc. They have breached their own agreement to communicate the account via email. This is a form of harassment and we need out of this account with First Premier Financial. We have bought XXXX cars from Best Car Buys since XX/XX/XXXX and never have seen such unprofessional treatment ever since First Premier Financial was created as the Financing Department. Their collection tactics are to harass	1
they continued to call me repeatedly. In fact	1
they continued to harass us by phone and correspondence that other payments were due. This went on continuously for a month and a half at the rate of a dozen calls per day ( XXXX kept a record ). I then sent a registered cease and desist letter	1
they corrected the fee. Now	1
they could NOT be included in any bankruptcy. The information listed under these XXXX accounts is fabricated. They are reporting as XXXX separate "" Unsecured Loans ''. The account numbers are also fabricated. They were open on the exact same date as the original credit cards with the same balances and limits. This is disturbing to me that TransUnion feels that they can make up accounts in my name and report them to my file as included in bankruptcy even after I 've sent them a list of my creditors where it shows that XXXX accounts were included	1
they could be over charging customers for millions over the years.	1
they could block the cards and that I would have to FAX information - including name	1
they could change the policy on new transactions	1
they could look it up. I paid my bill for the months that I used the service and did not move it because they lied to me when I signed up and I would not pay for to have the service moved when they assured me in my sign up that it was free. They broke the contract by not doing their part of the agreement. They should not be able to harm me or my credit by adding a report that does not reflect what really happened. It is not an unpaid bill. They did not supply the service that I signed up for and I am not responsible for it. They can not lie to get a consumer to purchase a service and not stand behind what they say	1
they could n't see "" anything to dispute '' on my reports as there were no "" new '' late payments added since XX/XX/XXXX!! I asked them what could be done to correct the inaccuracy and they said "" nothing '' as they could n't identify anything to dispute. They refused to resolve the issue and indicated there was no way to repair my credit score.Nor could they provide an alternative explanation to the precipitous drop in my score!	1
they could no longer locate my information. Apparently sometime in XXXX they turned me over to a collection agency	1
they could not do anything for me. The supervisor told me the same thing as well	1
they could not modify my loan. So	1
they could not provide that information. When I asked them to provide my signatures on the CC slip	1
they could not respond to any allegations regarding origination. Why did it take so long to tell me this? And why are you responding to my right to rescind? In which response you say that my loan originated XX/XX/XXXX which it did	1
they could not stop the sale. This is AFTER we had just told them we had an offer in hand from a qualified buyer. They still said because we only had 14 days	1
they could only bill VA a minimal amount. I recently requested that they submit the request for payment with the VA	1
they declined it	1
they declined me because of my other student debt. Now I can accept if they are not willing to do that as they are a private company and its their discretion	1
they declined to grant my request.	1
they demanded that I prove the product was defective by getting a third party opinion written on letterhead. When I claimed this was not possible and instead made and upload a youtube video with proof they said they were not going to accept video evidence. Finally	1
they denied because we had XXXX modification already. While we are in review	1
they denied the modification. Coincidently	1
they detected it. XXXX fraudulent charge for {$240.00} and XXXX for {$25.00}.	1
they determined that no error had occurred and the transaction in question was processed corectly. They stated that they would be debiting my account for the {$1000.00} on XXXX XXXX	1
they did a property assessment of $ XXXX. One letter told me they would "" suspend Foreclosure proceedings '' while they determined if I could qualify for a loan modification. Three+ months later ( this week ) they denied me. I can never get through to anyone and no one returns my emails. I had to file bankruptcy so my Citibank Mortgage loan was sold to XXXX XXXX/XXXX. They do not give you any information on your statement	1
they did all of this	1
they did bring the balance to a XXXX balance but have not removed it off my credit report. I 've called them since then about this situation and all they have done was give me the run-arounds - but the second time I called	1
they did go down to about 6 % when I signed it was 12.25 % and all these years I have been paying nothing but interest. I have called more times that I can count and asked for a refinancing or a rate modification and each time I am told "" sorry we do n't do that ''. it make 's me want to tell them well come get it then and give them a week to do so but I have put a lot of money into my home. my husband and I have reroofed it put floating floors thought out it and replaced to kitchen and bathroom floors with tile painted the out side this is home. I just do not understand how or why they are so unwilling to work with me my payments are on time never late but like everyone else I have a hard time and have to let other things go to make sure that it stays that way. I tried to trade it in before I we did all the work on it and all mobile home dealers in the area tell me the same thing "" you are up side down on the money '' your home is n't worth what you owe ''. where do I go? what do I do form here? is there any help for us? my home is on privet property family owed. the the company I am financed with has changed name 2or 3 times I have asked for help 2 times each from each of them once to refinance and then to do a loan rate modification.	1
they did n't care and are refusing to close on the loan if I do not purchase the Private Mortgage Insurance.	1
they did n't forward the bill to my new address so 6 months later	1
they did n't know who requested for that to happen on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
they did n't let me use it. This is bait and switch.	1
they did n't tell us he should 've been making some type of payment while in school. After he XXXX	1
they did not do so this year and I received a notice in the mail from XXXX XXXX stating that my property insurance was being cancelled due to non-payment by the mortgage company. That arrived on Sat.	1
they did not even initiate the transfer after I signed the agreement on XXXX XXXX as they themselves did not have the confirmation from the other dealership.Finally	1
they did not give me the 5 % discount they promised on the credit card. So I called Home Depot/Citibank customer service	1
they did not need to honor zone XXXX boarding. When purchasing the tickets	1
they did not produce any written contract from XXXX XXXX. I know that I was out of contract and within my right to change carriers. None of the involved parties wants to work to fix the problem. Please help.	1
they did not provide and documentation showing how the balances in their statement was developed. We have written them several QWR 's and letters but they refuse to address our disputes in a meaningful manner.	1
they did not request any money and they have not received any money ; that my loan was paid in full. I have spoken to at least XXXX different Nation Star Customer Service Agents and XXXX people in their Escrow Department and no one can tell me where my money is and why it has not been refunded.	1
they did not send confirmation of receipt of my email or fax	1
they did not want to discuss the matter and kept insisting that they had no knowledge. The original borrower of the loan has died and the lender is calling the loan ; for which	1
they did this without any cancellation notice. The local office agent informed us of the cancellation verbally over the phone the week prior to the XXXX of XXXX and we never received a renewal certificate before XXXX/XXXX/15 ( the date of renewal ). That prompted me to contact XXXX XXXX at the Florida Department of Financial Services because it is illegal to cancel without 90 days of notice. I hoped the state would take punitive action against XXXX XXXX. They left us with no time to rectify the situation. The mortgage company who was XXXX mortgage at that time	1
they directed me to a website ( XXXX ) where I can print a "" XXXX '' and send it back via e-mail. After feeling some relief that I would now be able to handle my student loans and would not be subject to face charges pressed against me	1
they disregarded everything I had to say and said I needed to pay something	1
they do believe I am not telling the truth. I can provide all the additional information needed to resolve this matter.	1
they do cause very costly delays. There needs to be a way that mortgage applicants can choose to waive these new guidelines.	1
they do have a responsibility. Either way	1
they do n't credit us with the payment and charged us {$190.00} late fees.	1
they do n't have good forbearance or debt management programs	1
they do n't seem to care when they shame me. Thanks	1
they do not match. Hence this leads to confusion on getting actual numbers and why my payment got increased {$200.00} a month.	1
they do not see XXXX balance on contract	1
they do not. Basically	1
they dont know what happend to my case and the lender who is now Nation Star said that I XXXX XXXX appear as the owner	1
they either only provided photocopies of incomplete documents or flatly refused to answer questions. During the time that I was disputing their ownership	1
they emailed me back on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX requesting to call them. I called Ally Bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX & spoke to a lady named XXXX @ XXXX ext. # XXXX & explained our situation & to see what our XXXX Options were. Being that we was 3 months behind	1
they estimated my XX/XX/XXXX insurance and the same rip-off rate that they are charging me through this company XXXX. Now due to the incompetence of the insurance and escrow departments	1
they even agreed to paying {$12000.00} towards the XXXX lien which is more than we were asking for ( {$2500.00} ). This does n't make since why they would accept the offer then say "" it does not meet investor guidelines ''. They think because we have an offer at $ XXXX that I can pay the payoff of $ XXXX and bring an additional $ XXXX to closing to pay off all the other expenses	1
they even turned off my monthly automatic payment without informing me. They have lost checks that I have sent them. They never return my telephone calls or e-mails. I have even made a complaint with the XXXX. The company 's website does not allow me to pay the extra principle without incurring additional fees. When the company does respond to my written complaints	1
they even went so far as to supply me with a letter that reads "" The "" last reported date of XX/XX/XXXX is an update that was requested in error. There has been no activity on this loan since it closed in XX/XX/XXXX '' signed by XXXX XXXX Servicing-Office of the President XXXX. Here is what XXXX was told by Equifax "" they explained to me that it could n't be removed ( embedded software programming ) ''. I also reached out to Equifax by phone and fax and to XXXX by phone spending hours on hold and explaining my situation to several managers at various levels	1
they even went so far as to supply me with a letter that reads "" The "" last reported date of XXXX is an update that was requested in error. There has been no activity on this loan since it closed in XX/XX/XXXX '' signed by XXXX XXXX XXXX of the President XXXX. Here is what XXXX was told by XXXX "" they explained to me that it could n't be removed ( embedded software programming ) ''. I also reached out to XXXX by phone and fax and to Experian by phone spending hours on hold and explaining my situation to several managers at various levels	1
they failed and I alerted the police to their illegal activities. The collection agency took off and I found out when the XXXX officer came by my home that they had not received a call letting XXXX know they were collecting a debt. B of A is claiming on my XXXX credit reports	1
they failed to accurately credit my account for finance charges. I paid off all new charges monthly	1
they failed to bring the account current	1
they failed to release the Writ	1
they figured that I was away and there will be no recourse from me and they can foreclose on my home in my absence. But fortunately	1
they filed with the XXXX XXXX Superior Court a complaint against me for nearly {$5000.00}. The debt shows on my credit score and it has negatively impacted my score and my financial reputation as I have in the last 12 months refinanced my home and am about to do so again. As a result of their tactics	1
they finally agreed to look into it. It took Carrington more than XXXX weeks to correct it	1
they finally credited my account and removed the {$1.00} late fee. In XX/XX/XXXX of this year	1
they finally issued a check which was sent to Bank of America. Bank of America had numerous request prior to them issuing the check to begin the work	1
they finally removed the charge	1
they finally told me the only thing they could give me was a repayment plan. They proceeded to raise my payment from {$1200.00} a month to over {$1600.00} a month. I asked them how this was suppose to help me and if I was having a hard time paying {$1200.00} how they could justify asking me to pay more. I asked them how this is suppose to ease my hardship. They told me I had no other choice unless I wanted to short sell the house or do a deed in lieu. I explained that I wanted to keep my house	1
they first agreed and I filed the paper work. They then changed their standing again and said this was a private loan so it could not be discharged. Please help.	1
they first would not do it and then just hung up. Eventually	1
they fixed the bill. But the next month they overcharged me. And I called to complain. So they fixed the bill. And then the next month they overcharged me again. So they fixed the bill	1
they found that a number was missing. After talking to several people	1
they froze his account and said they would not honor any checks written against the account	1
they gave me a financing offer that was XXXX of what I was getting from a direct dealer ( with my XXXX FICO score ). They kept me and my then XXXX old baby waiting around for XXXX hours ( kept saying "" they were taking care of us '' ) as we were negotiating on the price/financing and waiting for the car. When we finally reached an agreement and all papers were ready	1
they gave me the phone number for XXXX XXXX XXXX. They mailed me a debt verification form ( attached )	1
they gave us a modification which reduced our payment amount to {$1200.00}. They are now saying our payment amount is supposed to be {$1500.00}. I have documents showing the {$1200.00}	1
they get a hang up and the numbers are dialed back a few minutes later by numbers listed as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX when research in the Internet. The call are considered Robo Calls because there is no human person on the caller 's end when answered. This is strictly the callers intent to harass	1
they get charged fees like I did.	1
they give this number : XXXX EQUIFAX. Now	1
they got my phone number. They call me XXXX or XXXX times a day. I asked them what was the amount of the debt and they tell me XXXX that is current. I say ... current from 1986? These people continue to fish for more and more information. I am actually scared these people will continue to try to get info from me and try to get more info and use it against me.	1
they granted me payments that were lower pending finalization of my paperwork. I had to jump through hoops to get the modification paperwork done. In the mean time I paid a lesser amout on my mortgage for 3 months. After receiving all my paperwork	1
they had OVERCHARGED interest at the inception of the loan in the amount of {$1500.00}. The letter went on to explain that Chase unilaterally decided to apply this overpayment to the principal and that they will report this amount as reimbursed interest ( i.e. as INCOME XXXX in XXXX XXXX of my XX/XX/XXXX IRS Form XXXX. I have written them multiple times to object to this. I would like to have the money refunded so that I have money available to pay the TAXES NOW DUE on this "" reimbursement ''. XX/XX/XXXX	1
they had already started the foreclosure process. Then they sent me forms to sign	1
they had an error that was made on loan documents that were signed in XXXX and told me they would not give the approval to enter the Home Saver program until I signed a new Modification of Deed of Trust	1
they had been changing me over {$330.00} per month on Private Mortgage Insurance ( PMI ). Earlier this year	1
they had deleted all my phone numbers. I went online again to check my report. No changes have been made and the incorrect phone number is still on the site. I have not had a chance to call back as the office is only open from XXXX	1
they had issue with my wife 's bank statements claiming that the letter head was incorrect. We provided bank statements directly from the bank	1
they had it as a default on a loan and an ongoing debt not being paid. My x-wife and I had files all the paperwork with them and they do have it	1
they had lost our paperwork a couple of times as well. We do n't know what to do anymore.	1
they had me to sign a form stating that I wanted them to release the case number to the new lender. That is when he emailed me copies of a float down agreement that I signed	1
they had my permission to access my credit report for a credit line increase. The burden of proof is on them not me. If they indeed spoke a statement to me telling me they would have to do an inquiry to do a credit line increase	1
they had no more information on the debt. At the XXXX/XXXX/XXXX Motion to Compel hearing the Judge ordered an FTC Fraud Affidavit to be filed. XXXX See minute entry XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) I sent the FTC Fraud Affidavit along with a Police Report to XXXX XXXX XXXX Attn. Fraud Investigation. I informed Midland Funding LLC. I was a victim of fraud and I had submitted my FACTA request to the creditor. XXXX see letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to XXXX and XXXX XXXX After filing a CFPB complaint # XXXX against XXXX the original creditor	1
they had not adjusted my account. I supplied Conn 's with proof of the confirmation sheet that their rep had provided to me and they still refuse to adjust my account. Finally	1
they had not called me on this matter	1
they had over XXXX trade lines on me. I am calling the governors office in XXXX next	1
they had said after my discharge they would allow up to 6 months to catch up my loan. They did not hold up to that.	1
they had the payment but it was sitting in suspense on my account. It took 3 weeks for Penny Mac to correctly apply my payment and now they refuse to remove the hit on my credit.	1
they had to file bankruptcy. Every time	1
they had to respond to me in 30 days. They signed for the letter sent via priority mail XX/XX/XXXX. I called on XXXX when I had not heard anything. I was told by someone in the XXXX that they were working on it	1
they had wrong address	1
they hang up on me. They have hung up on me 29 times now. I just want my credit report. Can anyone help?	1
they hang up. I never get to talk to anyone and they never leave a message. They always call at XXXX minutes after XXXX my time ( PST ). I am sick of the harrassment and credit mark they forced onto my credit report. I work at a financial institution and pay my debts. I do not appreciate this "" zombie '' debt haunting me and my wife and the harrassing calls at work. I need help.	1
they harass without any problem	1
they have	1
they have XXXX spoken to me about the freeze they need lifted to complete their respective credit transactions.I HAVE SPOKEN TO EQUIFAX SECURITY FREEZE DEPT. again 3 more times.THEY HAVE authorized my credit card 2 more times ( proof enclosed ) and still can not release the freeze.THIS INCOMPETENCE AND TECHNICAL PROBLEM IS IMPACTING ME AND MY BUSINESS NEGATIVELY	1
they have XXXX up on their attempts to call my cell phone ... I am now getting calls from both numbers DAILY.	1
they have a judgment and can legal garnish my bank account. I 've told them many times that I never knew about this and how was it fair that I have to pay over what the original debt is because both XXXX XXXX XXXX and Riverview Law did not do their due diligence in properly informing me of this matter. If I was informed like they are saying I was why is it that they have a wrong last name for me	1
they have a right to close it and leaving me in the dark about it saying they sent me a letter when in fact they did n't. And was going to let me be embarassed when i went to purchase something	1
they have already charged me	1
they have always responded.	1
they have been asked to removed numerous times and have refused. These companies have cost me XXXX of dollars from getting loans ect.	1
they have been asked to removed numerous times and have refused. These companies have cost me thousands of dollars from getting loans ect.	1
they have been sending me XXXX-XXXX certified letters regarding my home mortgage and charging me almost {$10.00} per each letter and subtracting these charges from my monthly mortgage payments notwithstanding that many of the letters are duplicates. Ocwen has also been defrauding me by charging me late payment charges between {$150.00} and XXXX pet month and tacking this sum onto my principle balance. Included in these so called late payments are the accumulated certified letter charges	1
they have been trying to charge me a {$25.00} fee due to insufficient funds in my account when they took the second payment out in XX/XX/XXXX as an unauthorized ACH. Do not bank with them	1
they have been unfairly gaining interest on it while charging me additional interest at the same time.	1
they have been untruthful in regard to missing documents	1
they have changed their name. It started out as XXXX	1
they have charges that no other Bank has. They need to be regulated. Please investigate. thanks	1
they have chosen to be in "" non-compliance '' with the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act. I was never able to get a copy of this negative report LexisNexis gave to XXXX XXXX which caused a higher price.	1
they have contacted the original creditor and hold a copy of the bill from the original creditor. I did receive this copy and was informed that this should be considered proof that the debt belongs to me. I have advised them that I will be filing a complaint with the XXXX also the FTC and the Attorney General 's office. I ask for your help towards figuring out the next steps in resolving this matter. Any assistance you can provide will be greatly appreciated.	1
they have denied it again without specifying what kind of proof they need. It seems like Paypal 's Purchase Protectin is a scam. They keep filing and denying you for no good reason until you give up. In this case	1
they have denied me. In my first attempt years ago I fully understood why ; their calculations	1
they have done nothing of the sort. I can see why people throw the towel in because they make it so difficult. My interest rate is 6.75 % and they could very well reduce my rate and make it easier. I am asking for help. They are saying even after I appeal this time that there will be no more appeal so time is of the essence. Please help.	1
they have filed suit against me for the same amount. While going through their paperwork	1
they have had lawsuits filed against them in the past for these same illegal tactics to extend the damage they can do to consumers with regards to their credit long after the debt has been paid.	1
they have ignored this information and continue to try to subject me XXXX.. I am asking CFPB to demand/command wells fargo explain why they say these policy and procedures dont exist.They have caused a significant financial burden and lost of time trying to deal with a organization that intends to wait me out and foreclose on this property. My complaint is simply that wells fargo is using lies and deception to steal my property. refuses to acknowledge regulation z/ successor-in-interest XXXX rules regulation as of XXXX/XXXX/2014 says there are no procedures for anything from the CFPB	1
they have indicated that I could get a card	1
they have inflatedthe amount by adding interests	1
they have lied to me on every phone call about their right to call me and more disturbing in the abusive and argumentative conversation from a CitiBank Representative on the XXXX XXXX phone call which took place at XXXX. I STRONGLY SUGGEST SOMEONE get a copy of that recording. I do not need that type of argumentative conversation to take place in front of family members and my mother. The call was witnessed by at least XXXX people since I had it on "" SPEAKER '' I asked each person to write down what they heard so I had some sort of documentation while information was fresh in their minds. I fully intend to file a lawsuit as I do have a law background. I would hope the CFPB follows up in some assertive way as I also run a Political website ( XXXX ) currently under re-construction so can can handle the heavier than expected traffic. However	1
they have made XXXX auto dial calls.	1
they have made over 26 calls. I sent a second letter to them at that time. Since then they have called 26 more times. I have sent letters to other creditors and they have acknowledged them and have stopped calling. This company wo n't stop and if I answer the call	1
they have me listed as late once. NO I WAS NOT. They have the wrong account number on the pay stub every month. My accout ends in XXXX and the stub always ends in XXXX and until it was caught they called me late. To this day is still says XXXX and I have to cross out everytime before I pay or I am stuck in line for a half an hour while they try to figure it out. I have called and complained on this as well and they simply say no it is correct. This bank is run by idiots and is a crime to anyone with common sense. They are only trying to hurt me and my wifes name because we got an attorney involved to dispute fraudelent charges on some lines that we had. I have been told by a friend in upper Management at Wells that Wells has contacted all of the local banks and not to lend to me and that Wells is to be contacted if I go to their banks looking for money to borrow. This is black balling and is a crime in the United states of America and suit will be pending if this is not corrected. This is a serious crime and demands direct attention.	1
they have multiple offices in XXXX	1
they have my account is "" suspense '' because I am not paying the incorrect payment amount they keep saying that I owe. I have been paying an amount that was provided to me by XXXX of their employees. As soon as today	1
they have never posted the credit to my account. I have in-hand a letter dated XXXX XXXX	1
they have never responded in writing or in any way with an explanation of the fees or a way to resolve these. The practice continues to this day.	1
they have never seen the inside of my home but value it at the top of the market	1
they have not contacted me.	1
they have not done anything. This company has received {$400.00} and have failed to do what their contract states.	1
they have not done so. What is my recourse? How can I get the protection I need to resolve this problem? I am a consumer and stuck in the vortex of a large federal organization who 's common practice is to provide unfair customer service to students	1
they have not once tried to contact me-and I 've verified that all of my contact info on file is correct. I did not receive a single phone call or email from them until yesterday XXXX XXXX XXXX ) which is the same day that my family members received their letters from XXXX. More importantly	1
they have not started any process from their side. I am afraid that they will claim that they never received my paperwork for an appeal and	1
they have obviously ignored my numerous efforts to get them to conform because they have never once responded to this issue. So far	1
they have on the first page of my bill there 's an expiration date	1
they have pocketed {$170.00} that should have gone to my principal. They are also applying my principal payment almost 60 days late.	1
they have pretended to claim that I was paying taxes	1
they have probably written laws that prevent that. It was clearly observable that I was living in XXXX during the years they tried to put the bills on me and that I was not that person. This situation ruined our family 's life at a critical time of unemployment and need	1
they have refused to allow me to redeem my gift cards	1
they have refused to report my good payment history to XXXX	1
they have refused too and sent to to collections.	1
they have repeatedly lied about paperwork and documents missing.The last modification they wanted us to sign was for a whole new amount due	1
they have resolved	1
they have sent to my credit report that i am deceased. I cant apply for my dream home	1
they have sent us. We have sent bank receipts for these missing payments and asked where is the money we paid to them. They just said their records do n't match ours and that the matter has concluded and is closed. {$480.00} is due by the XXXX of each month. We also have a XXXX day grace period before late fees are due. We always send payment by XXXX of month in amount of {$500.00}.	1
they have several different numbers they use	3
they have some ridiculous landline number with XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) for a area code. What do you call this sloppy incompetence?! # Willful gross negligence	1
they have stated that they can not work with my case through email or mail. The only communication I 've received is in the form of a telephone number. I have also received threats against my paycheck in the form of garnishments and my tax return. I have attempted to make payments where and when I can	1
they have the wrong guy. they assured me that if it was not reflecting on my credit	1
they have their own residence and do not contribute to the household and I also have a transfer upon death deed filed with XXXX County. I was told by one of Wells Fargo 's underwriters that if I could submit an affidavit to this affect that my grandparents social security income would not be needed. Needless to say I was denied a loan modification	1
they have to consider that car notes and furniture credit have a termination date. Paying them off should earn consumers praise rather than penalty.	1
they have to follow Texas laws and register with the Secretary of State and pay a {$10000.00} surety bond. He stated he could not find ADR Group having registered. I feel like this business is trying to bully me into paying for something that is not mine by using illegal tactics and I feel they might be doing it to others as well. I tried to contact the company again and they put me on hold and would not speak to me.	1
they have told us ever since that we have been late on paying when we have not been	1
they have violated Regulation E of Title 12 of set forth in the CFR.	1
they have yet to come up with or show me any proof that this debt actually exists and/or is still outstanding. Meanwhile	1
they hold of all of the loans in a trust. This information was verified by XXXX and they kept repeating that NCT is only a trust	1
they hung up on me and proceeded to try again the next day. It 's getting really irritating and they call sometimes at XXXX when my kids are asleep.	1
they hung up on me when I asked if I could record the conversation.	1
they hung up on me. I called back and talked to another representative and she stated that they had no record of any of my emails and could not help me with the matter. In addition to only being able to tell me how to pay the debt that was n't mine	1
they ignore us. I want this blight removed and I have gotten no satisfaction from this company.	1
they ignored it and kept dunning us for a payment or payments we do not owe	1
they ignored me again. Because of this	1
they immediately charged my debit card {$450.00} for closing the loan. I never accepted the loan or good faith estimate so this does not seem legal. When I asked the loan agent	1
they immediately said they 'd waive this amount	1
they immediately started placing all of my monthly payments in a private BofA account	1
they improperly weight 2 late payments as extremely credit lowering	1
they improperly weight XXXX late payments as extremely credit lowering	1
they in return continued to lie that the home was not insured and has since kept this property on my credit report as a debt.	1
they increased my payment by charging me additional fees of {$110.00} each month. Additionally	1
they indicated I had an balance of {$160.00} and were ready to take a payment. In fact the account was XXXX which had already been paid but yet here they were trying to take a payment for an account which was no longer theirs.	1
they indicated that on XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
they indicated they corrected my number and would stop calling while in dispute. 5 hours later	1
they informed me because I have shopped with that merchant before it is not fraud. I work in credit cards for another group and this is ridiculous! I even had another card compromised for the same dates and same exact charges from the same merchant. The other credit card company took care of my needs right away as fraud. I never shopped with the merchant on those dates nor signed those receipts and I told Bank of America they needed to pursue with the fraud case again. They told me they would not. I went ahead and closed the account and told them I will not pay anything. They continue to send me notices of payment dues. I do not want this to end up being sent to the credit bureau when I have fraud charges on my account not taken care of. I 'm pleading to ask what I can do to have this matter handled correctly. Thank you for you help.	1
they informed me that I can not request to only have the insurance removed. I have to ask for the taxes to be removed as well. ANOTHER piece of information that I was not informed of before. To top it off	1
they informed me that I had only three months to pay off the full {$450.00}. I was not aware of this and in none of the multiple phone calls did anyone state that this was the case. Otherwise I would have paid the entire amount prior to the three month mark to avoid a mark on my credit. I have paid off the full amount now ( less that three months after it went into collects ) but now there remains a mark on my credit for a collection agency.	1
they informed me that this was from registration in 1991. I informed them that I never registered with their college to attend because I was attending XXXX during that time. They said that it did n't matter and that they were not going to make any changes to my account. I started wondering if this was fair since the account was so old and they never place this account in collections until a few years ago. Let me be clear that this is not my account and that I never attended this school and this is not related to any student loan account. I 'm wondering why am I still dealing with account that 's over XXXX years old. I have since disputed this account with XXXX XXXX	1
they informed us that a check for {$1500.00} had not cleared and bounced	1
they initially refused to let me. I told them it was a private matter	1
they instantly lied and said they did n't do it. I am attaching both adjustments. The XXXX was removed. They XXXX was not. They keep lying about it. I want proof of why they keep adding money to my card which is not purchases and i do not owe MONTHS after a dispute is closed. Please help me	1
they instead unilaterally decided to "" offer me the courtesy '' of not having my charge denied. This is completely unacceptable. I would much rather have my card denied	1
they interrupted me and told me all the time that it is my fault i did not pay my bill on time XXXX but I paid bill which i got from mail ). When I asked the name of the lady who talked to me on the phone she said her name very quickly and when I asked to spell for me she said that spelling the same as a pronunciation. She did not give her name. I asked to transfer me to she supervisor	1
they investigated and gave me a refund credit of XXXX	1
they issued an erroneous XXXX	1
they just admitted to another lie. If your department pulls out all the information that we sent you	1
they just called to say that I did graduate and that I would be a good employee. They never said that this school has a very bad reputation with the XXXX and employers wont even look at you when you say that you went to that school. Every place that I put an application in in Florida	1
they just changed their name - this is extremely deceptive and this is what they are telling people that call in. XXXX 's intimation to us was that any illegal acts that Green Tree committed were water under the bridge as Ditech is a different company - this is quite possibly XXXX the most ridiculous things I have heard.	1
they just disconnect you. I have called them six times and can not get a straight answer. A supervisor will not get on the phone and will not return the call. I do not know where else to turn short of taking them to court. I do not understand how they can just put something on my credit report	1
they just excelerated my loan. The last notice of default that I received from Interbank ( XXXX ) was in XXXX XXXX. I filed bankruptcy twice	1
they just keep calling me. I know my rights and the laws and they are violating them.	1
they just keep increasing the amount owed. How can they keep a cosigner on for years and keep threatening her and why do n't they just accept a reasonable payment that a person could afford?	1
they just kept asking me for a lot of paperwork over and over again. After fulfilling all of their requirements and demands	1
they just remove $ 4K+ from my account a month early.	1
they just renew dates on the credit bureau reports.	3
they just sent the fake XXXX bill to transunion	1
they just turned off my account then re-opened it and sent a "" New/Same '' card	1
they just want us to pay.	1
they just went ahead and dinged the credit report. XX/XX/XXXX I received my first correspondence from Nissan saying that the cars had been returned and that I owed almost {$3000.00} in late fees and damages	1
they keep calling. Collector stated that he does n't have to contact via mail and that he can do whatever he wants. I am concerned for my well being and mental health if this does n't get resolved ASAP.	1
they keep giving us the run around. They said that we need to short-sale and if not they will give us 3 months to do a deed of liue and help us with relocation cost	1
they keep me on the phone for nearly 2 hours and made speak to 8 different people who kept telling me. "" That 's not my department. '' an then tell me I 'm the one who has to prove it.	1
they keep saying they have not received the documents requested and I have email them many times. Attached are the Documents they requested and said they did not receive.	1
they keep telling me it takes time to process. Finally in XXXX	1
they kept asking for more all the time dragging it out. They have put a foreclosure on the house and I need that action stopped until this issue can be resolved. I called the mortgage company weekly to get an update and was always told it was in the review stage and that they needed additional information. I immediately faxed all required documents - they probably have XXXX or XXXX copies of everything. When I called them on XXXX/XXXX/15 XXXX told me that I had been denied because I had n't had everything to them within the 120 day requirement. At no time was I told that I had 120 days to get all of this done. Actually everything was to them within that time limit but they are the one 's that kept asking for more and more. They also said that I would have a letter from HUD stating that I was denied within 10 days and I have never received a letter from HUD stating this.	1
they kept asking me "" When in XXXX XXXX next month ) can we start the payment of {$680.00} XXXX which is more than double of what I currently pay )? '' They practice of debt collection should not be legal and I do n't believe they are disclosing information and options for my loan payments.	1
they kept claiming they could not talk to me until I confirmed my social. When I again stated until I could identify their company I was not giving that out	1
they kept informing me they did n't get some of the information they needed. So	1
they kept it in loan mod for XXXX as long. They did not do correct accounting and by refusing my payments while in loan mod they attempted to deny again. They delayed the loan modification by stalling on accepting payments and creating late fees. They foreclosed on me while in loan mod and then did not change ownership back to me when the foreclosure was rescinded in court.	1
they kept my car. When I called to inquire about paying for the fees and making a payment they gave me a run around for a whole week	1
they kept switching my contract person	1
they kicked us out	1
they knew full well that I was in litigation with XXXX XXXX condo assoc. and that XXXX XXXX XXXX were their legal representatives. Still Ocwen paid XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. {$21000.00} even before my case went to court. As Ocwen claims they	1
they knew they were wrong!! The note also stated if not vacant or abandoned to call immediately. This note was on the outside of the door	1
they knowingly financed a car knowing its not road safe according to Texas Safety law inspection. I told them I wanted they money back on the deal {$1000.00} down and a payment of {$270.00}	1
they later changed there name to Homeward Residential. In XXXX XXXX the servicing of the loan was transferred to OCWEN Loan Servicing. Ever since XX/XX/XXXXI have paid my own Insurances. In XXXX of XXXX	1
they lent me $ XXXX at 29.99 % with the understanding that THEY would deduct the monthly payment from my WF checking. Before I got that XXXX loan	1
they let me down	1
they let me make a payment over the phone but charged me extra. Even though I complained about this the first time	1
they let me slide on their mistake for a year	1
they list it as delinquent from the date I was in the hospital. They also list the terms of agreement as 1 month. all these should be marked n/aThey also refuse to remove the comments from the account calling it a collection in dispute	1
they lowered it XXXX more. The day after I had this happen I called XXXX XXXX and told her there is no way I can pay what they told me I was going to have to pay ( house payment ) now it is XXXX plus shorter. i was transferred to another loan person	1
they made an agreement	1
they made my HELOC a second mortg	1
they made no attempt to contact me via phone or email within the federally required time to rectify the situation	1
they made no effort to correct the erroneous and damaging information they continue to disseminate while the other credit reporting agencies are reporting the account correctly ( please see attached ).	1
they made no further provision for payments. The days of which I participated on-line was to be paid through financial aid. It is my understanding that I had the jurisdiction to withdraw without penalty/payment expected	1
they made over XXXX collection attempts	1
they make it extremely difficult to match up a purchase to what was rewarded back to the customer. Purchase history is on one site and reward history on another site and of cousre there are delays in reporting. Then customer service claims they have no view into rewards	1
they may have absconded with these funds themselves and are foisting this loan off on me to cover their financing of XXXX or XXXX.	1
they merely write the name of the business on the card	1
they moved forward with foreclosure proceedings even though we were working XXXX jobs to pay a lawyer to help us negotiate with them on loan modification and/or short sale. By XXXX XXXX they foreclosed. Ever since they have counted seven years from XXXX XXXX as if that is our first delinquency but it is NOT. The first delinquency that led to the foreclosure was XXXX XXXX. We are essentially being punished for doing what they asked and sending in money in order to have them agree to work with us on loan modification. We are now actually almost eight years past first delinquency which was XXXX XXXX. But GMAC went bankrupt in XX/XX/XXXX so we are not able to get any documentation from GMAC or Homecomings regarding anything that happened prior to the XX/XX/XXXX transfer. The credit agencies will not respond to our multiple disputes ( more than XXXX ) and GMAC no longer seems to exist. In XX/XX/XXXX we were given the opportunity for government review of the mortgage with GMAC due to all the illegal dealings GMAC had been involved with. We declined. However	1
they moved my file out of the pending short sale department and it went into an active foreclosure status again charging me {$3000.00} for a {$25.00} filing fee with the courts. They knew that I would be paying them in full in 10 days. I feel that there was no reason for doing this to me and I filed a complaint with them on XXXX/XXXX/2015. I closed on my home on XXXX/XXXX/15 and they were paid in full for all late fees and penalties and interest along with this additional	1
they must investigate the accounts AND they have to verify the information received by the data furnishers. Once I notify them that the results are still not correct	3
they need to delete any and all negative information reported to all credit agencies associated with this account.	1
they need to explain things to me.	1
they need to move on and stop harassing me with false accusations. Their standard telephone tactic is they will not identify themselves UNLESS the person answers confirms who they are. They also WILL NOT reveal information of the person responsible for the debt. Yet they INSIST on your information. How can you intelligently confirm you are not responsible for the debt if they do not cooperate. These calls have gone long enough and has violated my privacy rights as well as to continually harass me with false accusations. They have clearly violated the "" Fair Debt Collections Practice Act ''. I want an end to these harassing calls and request your agency audit their business practices.	1
they need to stop calling me. Or I 'll have them sued for phone harassment. I understand they 're bill collectors and all but I 'm not made of money. If I do n't have it	1
they needed more documents. I do n't understand any of this process. Do n't think RCS does either. For the repayment plan	1
they never capped that max and now I am in debt over XXXX dollars. XXXX loan alone went from XXXX original to now XXXX owed. These are just private loans- not including my federal. I am paying OVER XXXX a month in student loans! My entire income is going to this debt. It is not affordble to me nor to my cosignor. They took advantage of nieve borrowers. It wasnt until grad school did I learn of my total amount owed and how these XXXX lenders XXXX us by not stopping the approval process at XXXX max. I have XXXX children and a husband in the military. We are rapidly going in debt and losing things because this is consuming us. They harrass us and our family daily. Sometimes calling 30 times a day	1
they never changed the status of account after it being {$0.00} balance. still showing 'open ' in status. I do not think it should be this difficult to do something that is logic an sensible. For collection agencies like these that not a part of XXXX or anything to govern them	1
they never corrected any of the issues and they sold the loan to Nationstar.	1
they never did. After the Banks review XXXX called to confirm that the bank did not find me in favor and are holding me responsible for all monies and fees. He also explained that the bank would agree to let me make payment arrangements to clear the account. I replied that I felt they were treating me as if I was the criminal. He told me to imagine if the criminal was caught and possibly prosecuted that he more then likely would not be able to pay the bank back and someone has to be held responsible. He said because this is your account you would be responsible for the banks money. He then threatened if I did not take care of the account that my name will be put on a list of writing bad checks and I will never be able to bank with any banks. While the investigation with the police is still on going I am the victim	1
they never did. I purchased the email addresses for their corporate level management and emailed them. Someone emailed me back and said someone will be in touch. It 's been 13 days and no response. I have tried to contact them multiple times via telephone and email and they have been unresponsive. My credit score has now been severely impacted and I 'm in the process of refinancing which may impact my ability to close. I have submitted disputes with all three credit bureaus. I am furious and can not believe that a company I 've had an account with for 9 years would violate my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. A company that so blatantly violates a consumers rights in this manner should be made an example.	1
they never processed the dispute for the charge.	1
they never recieved the payment	1
they never responded after that and the are still reporting on my credit report as well as sending updates to the credit bureau	1
they never returened the equiptment so XXXX XXXX charged me XXXX for the returned equipment that was never returned. I was unaware of this and now I am receivign a collection notice from a debt collection company called Afni	1
they never return my calls or emails. I feel that they dragged out every process and never really wanted to help me save my home.	1
they never sent shipping label	1
they never went towards full mortgage payments! When it rains it pours! I lost my job and income went from {$85000.00} a year to {$28000.00} a year as of last year! A complaint of that discharge is still pending. In the meantime with Ditech which was formerly Green Tree	1
they not only continue to report this on my credit	1
they now are dropping notes off at all my neighbors homes and in my XXXX mail box	1
they now say that they have not received my last fax. I haveconfirmation that have received my fax.	1
they offer me no other solutions.	1
they offer options for disputing incorrect information	1
they only accept documents via fax/mail and I have no idea that my sent faxes are being received/processed so I have no way of confirming. This entire process has been an ordeal.	1
they only issued me a {$50.00} credit. I complained to Discover Bank but was told they needed 6-8 weeks to "" investigate '' the issue. This seems like a well thought out scam - the bank gets my money and can loan it out or invest it at a higher rate than I am receiving	1
they opened a new account and left the old account active. I did n't realize this at first and started receiving notice for late payments. I would pay them	1
they over and over make you set up phone appointments with Relationship Managers who continually tell you that some other dept. ( which you can not talk with ) is working on the complaint and will have an answer is 2 to4 business days - the answer never comes and the run and round never stops. We need our money and it is very clear they do not not intend to give it to us! They are nothing better than crooks defrauding their customers. They have lost XXXX sets of papers sent only to now ignor us completely. Yesterday they said a ltr. went out to answer the complaint - i asked for it to be emailed - this am it came. They answered the question about foreclosure costs ( we we never in forecloser ) and again stated they could ask fo the appraisal - they did not even mention the roof replacement. MY WIFE AND I ARE IN OUR XXXX 'S AND OUR HEALTH IS NOT GOOD AND GETTING WORSE EVERYTIME I HAVE TO CHASE THEM AND END UP A SCREAMING MANIAC FOR THEIR IGNORANCE AND ILLEGAL MANUEVERING!!! THEY ARE GOING TO KILL XXXX! WHY IS THIS COMPANY ALLOWED TO DO THIS - THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF COMPLAINTS ON THE INTERNET AND NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT THEM ... WHY ARE N'T THEY EXPOSED IN THE MEDIA FOR WHO THEY ARE - LIARS	1
they over paid the premium by almost {$1200.00}. In today 's mail I received information on an escrow and they want to add {$790.00} per month to our payment. We have never had an escrow and do n't want an escrow. And what they are charging is more then XXXX times the cost of our insurance.	1
they paid months of trial payments when only 90 days was sufficient by law. I started the modification process XX/XX/XXXX	1
they pay it! I did not sign any change forms authorizing a different insurance company to bill my mortgage company. They pretty much said "" oh well '' HELP!!!!	1
they postpone and then count it against me. Previously they were postponing for 30 days	1
they pressured us	1
they prey on unsuspecting consumers these career criminals even go to the extreme of dragging you outside of your 60-120 day grace period to dispute the charge with the Credit Card Company or bank account with guarantees of success and profitable returns. I feel that this falls under the claims and defense guidelines that state that you have anywhere from 365 to 540 days to respond	1
they proceeded with got a garnishment with my local court and theirs to now lock onto my tax return even though I paid the debt in full! Now they say I owe them {$480.00}!	1
they provided me {$20000.00} to get the project started. However	1
they pushed forward with a foreclosure and filed judgement against me in local court. The are requesting additional information from my husband	1
they put me on hold for almost an hour and I finally had to hang up. I called the next day to complain and asked to talk to a supervisor	1
they put my house for sale at an auction and it was sold to XXXX. I really need your help as soon as possible. I want to work with the bank	1
they put the blame on XXXX	1
they put them in dispute along with other accounts I did n't ask to be blocked. When I called in a lady in their fraud department said it is up to the creditors to remove the data	1
they put them in dispute. When I called in a lady in their fraud department said it is up to the creditors to remove the data	1
they raised the monthly payment to {$340.00} per month. I can only anticipate they will continue to raise it. I currently owe them nearly {$1500.00}. Additionally	1
they received it XX/XX/XXXX ) asking them to tell me specifically WHEN my escrow account went into a shortage and HOW much. They have sent me XXXX letters ( XXXX XXXX	1
they recently responded with the attached letter. In that letter	1
they recognized the wrongdoing of their actions. They also "" recalled '' from their law firms	1
they redeposited the payment despite me calling them at the end of XXXX to complain about their ineptness and causing me a great deal of stress and embarrassment.Now it has caused me XXXX which they refuse to reimburse unless I fax a bank statement showing these charges. I have no available fax machine nor should I be forced to pay additional money for their stupidity.I told them to call my credit union to verify a returned check fee. They refused.I 've had to deal with a great deal of XXXX	1
they reduced the rate to 0.27 %. I contacted them and told them that I did not agree to this interest rate and that they should close the account and send me my money back. They kept promising to fix this "" mistake ''. Nothing happened even after almost 3 months of my attempts and utmost frustration. I asked them to close the account and send me my money and they failed to do that after several months. In the meantime I am losing money	1
they referred us to Nationstar. We contacted Nationstar several times	1
they refunded all the fees and late fees associated with the error. I appreciate that	2
they refuse to change the attorney information. I had another foreclosure hearing this morning. PNC 's improper refusal to discuss my own account with me	1
they refuse to do this. Instead	1
they refuse to give me my balance. On XXXX of my receipts	1
they refuse to initiate the file in XXXX.	1
they refuse to refund this {$250.00} legal fee. Instead they gave me a PO box address and told me to write a letter to that address. This is completely unacceptable.	1
they refuse to remove the additional information because the source reported it that way	1
they refuse to repay me for the cost of the VA funding fees. We could use some help with this.	1
they refuse to say that it was a matter of fraud. They are treating it as a matter of my word against the beneficiary 's	1
they refuse to stop the escrow included in my monthly payments.	1
they refuse to tell me why they are even placing the check holds to begin with. Unacceptable.	1
they refuse to work with	1
they refused and they wanted me to pay for the whole thing.	1
they refused to assist me because I 'm current on my mortgage payments.	1
they refused to close my escrow account saying that my flood insurance is n't paid	1
they refused to credit me back any of these charges	1
they refused to do so	1
they refused to drop the price so that I could secure a buyer. At the same time there was a pending foreclosure sale date. I had to escalate the file and make XXXX phone calls to convince them to postpone the foreclosure sale date. They only moved the sale date to XXXX/XXXX/2015. Now we are a week away from the F/C Sale date and once again they threatened me with the pricing of the home	1
they refused to lower the monthly payment	1
they refused to refund us our mortgage interest	1
they refused to review the application	1
they refused to show my court documents to the court	1
they refused to unlock my card and account unless I answered questions which I could only do by looking at my account. One question was in regards to recurring monthly transactions on the card. I explained that I needed access to view my account in order to provide that info as I have recurring transactions on several cards but they refused to enable my card and unlock my account. I was of course quite upset and told them to cancel my card	1
they refused. Magically a file appeared a few years later	1
they removed in XX/XX/2015 and put it right back on again the same month.	1
they removed in XXXX and put it right back on again the same month.	1
they removed the XXXX accounts from XXXX and XXXX	1
they repeat my balance over and over and tell me when my last payment was made. There is still no resolution. It is XXXX XXXX	1
they reported it as a short sale	1
they reported my loan to collections. XX/XX/XXXX they overcharged me on student loan payments. The charged me late fees when I was n't even making any real money. I signed up for an Income based repayment plan and they took out more money than was authorized out of my account. They did this multiple times. I had to wait a week just to call Discover Student Loans to find out they did n't even start the refund process even though they said they would. I ended up waiting an additional 2 weeks for XXXX refund. They stole more money out of my account a second time and I had to wait another 2 weeks for a XXXX refund. They never gave me a fair chance at paying off my student loan. I have complained numerous times XX/XX/XXXX and here we are XX/XX/XXXX with no help. The loan accumulated interest and got sent to a collection agency/lawyer. Discover Student Loans treated me like I was n't even a human being. I have never felt so disrespected in my life. I think I got harassed because I do n't have a white sounding last name	1
they represented that	2
they requested to Texas XXXX to submit the appropriate forms	1
they responded asking me for my new card information when I submitted that I never received a response. It is now XXXX/XXXX/2015 I am yet to access my money	1
they responded within 5 days. I was unable to attend XX/XX/XXXX court date because this date was within the first week of myreturn XXXX	1
they ret 'd my check and refused the payment that was above the amount of my house payment. SInce transferring my mortgage to GreenTree	1
they routed me to the fraud department	1
they said	1
they said I failed to the court proceeding and I did but incorrectly	1
they said I had to pay around XXXX and also I had to have a proof that I had that amount	1
they said I needed to pay the entire statement balance in order to stop the massive interest charges. Gave no reason as to why my rate changed and then the rep tried to tell me everyone 's rate is the same	1
they said I would travel the world and could make salaries from XXXX p/y. I was very confident	1
they said If I could get it done before the foreclosure date which was less then 60 days away. I let the house go. I was beside myself and felt so betrayed.I finally lost the house in XX/XX/XXXX. I just saw that GREEN TREE settled a lawsuit from you with similar cicumstances. I still owe {$49000.00} of the {$65000.00} I put into that house. Can you help me?	1
they said if i did not pay today it would be out of their hands and the sheriff would be coming to my house for their client. He then started to state all my personal information that he could not have unless he pulled up my credit report which he had no authorization to do. I am not scared because I have dealt with them before	1
they said it is process and takes 7-10 business days. I am getting no where with Seneca Mortgage Company.	1
they said it was being processed	1
they said it was still incorrect and chase cancelled my loan modification. I dont know why I am being punished for notary error. I asked them to send me another package	1
they said it would change in XX/XX/XXXX and not to worry about it XX/XX/XXXX Well my usual payment is about {$1600.00} and when I woke up XXXX XXXX my new payment was XXXX. I went nuts and me and my wife and family barely survived. This is just wrong	1
they said my account is "" related '' to the accounts under the following e-mails "" XXXX '' and that {$500.00} is owed. So they have locked up {$1800.00}. They even went into my bank account and made an unauthorized withdrawal of {$29.00}. I do not owe Paypal ANY MONEY and it 's illegal for them to be holding my funds.	1
they said no. I asked because they have violated the law multiple times with me. First	1
they said nothing can be done until MOnday when management is present.	1
they said so long I have change in income I could apply again	1
they said that I asked that they do not call me	1
they said that I suppose to make the payments for XXXX and XXXX	1
they said that it was an error in their system and they would correct it. Every month thereafter	1
they said that the service was the best even with rain or winds	1
they said that the servicer can allow a modification	1
they said that their legal department will not speak to customers but they informed the BOA customer service manager that the collection agency 's letter stated to remove the {$2900.00} for "" housing expenses '' the judgment was for an XXXX. I informed him that I have a copy of the letter that was sent to BOA as well as confirmation from the employee who issued the letter XXXX stating that BOA was completely wrong. They are still continuing to hold all of my funds. I told them I can understand holding the {$680.00} until the letter has been processed	1
they said that they sent the check of XXXX or XXXX but they did n't adjust that payment	1
they said the bank has to do it. I want this to be removed from my credit report. I was misinformed and my credit inquiry was used without my authorization. I want to put a complaint againt Bank of America.	1
they said the cancellation letter crossed in the mail. So they told me over the phone the items that I was still missing or incomplete. This time around	1
they said the car needed new wheel barrings	1
they said they are sure it wassent! I called Ins. company	1
they said they could not help me. After using up all of our resources we fell behind on our payments and the bank began to contact me. During the next several months we worked on a modification to resolve our problem. After months of work and mountains of paper work	1
they said they did n't have them. They said I had to send a third time and I could fax. This is very concerning as I sent highly sensitive personal information. I faxed it although I was very hesitant to do so. I sent these letters back on XXXX XXXX and they signed for it on XXXX XXXX ( 2015 ) and I sent it again XXXX XXXX. I 'm now concerned other fraudulent accounts may have been opened due to their lack of integrity and service issues. I want them to freeze my credit and send me updated report.	1
they said they had no idea	1
they said they never heard of Credit Management.	1
they said they only act as a clearing house for money transfers and that it 's a Chase issue. Chase says it 's a XXXX XXXX issue and XXXX XXXX does not find the money anywhere and says it 's a Chase issue. NO ONE IS HELPING ME!! I have a "" transaction number '' yet it seems to be worthless. WHO CAN I GO TO FOR HELP TO RETURN OUR {$550.00}?	1
they said they only act as a clearing house for money transfers and that it 's a XXXX issue. XXXX says it 's a Wells Fargo issue and Wells Fargo does not find the money anywhere and says it 's a XXXX issue. NO ONE IS HELPING ME!! I have a "" transaction number '' yet it seems to be worthless. WHO CAN I GO TO FOR HELP TO RETURN OUR {$550.00}?	1
they said they only charged fees for transactions over {$5.00}. XXXX of the fees they charged in fact violated that policy by being for {$3.00} each. They voluntarily refunded XXXX unspecified fees as a matter of courtesy. There policy is n't in line with XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
they said they were busy and would call me by the end of the week. No one called. I called them again later that week	1
they said they were the new finance company	1
they said they would correct the error and I would not have to pay. However	1
they said they would modify my loan and 3 days later	1
they said they would remove the claim. Then they started calling him again. The attorney called and as soon as he said he was the attorney	1
they said you can not load more than $ 1K a day .... Well I loaded $ 1K a few days ago and have tried to load my {$400.00} repack card everday	1
they saw no relevance to my plea for a review of the recording of that call and resisted arranging it. As a result	1
they saw nothing of the shutdown ( or so I 'm told ). I 'm expecting this to take another XXXX months to get resolved ( if at all ) courtesy of incompetent service reps.	1
they say	1
they say i have mortgage	2
they say it 's all an issue with BOFA system.	1
they say they have not received it. I started emailing with an email receipt and have not received one as of yet. I have also been informed that I have a dedicated account manager	1
they say they will look into and call back and i have been waiting on the calls	1
they say they will send me substantiation of the debt	1
they see all documents but say there is nothing they can do once it is closed and I will have to resubmit. And the entire debacle starts again. When I asked where do I file a complaint	1
they seem to be debt collectors	1
they seem to be from a company called STP Management. Further investigation on my part shows that their phone numbers XXXX and XXXX are associated with fraudulent shakedowns and illegal debt collecting practices. STP Management is listed as an F ranking on the XXXX and is currently being investigated by them.	2
they send me a e-mail on a XXXX escrow fee returned to me	1
they send me a letter stating that they would adjust my account. I received another statement today ( XXXX XXXX 2016 ) and my account has not been adjusted. They send me a letter stating that I was in default of my loan. I have done my own research on this company and have found that they have done this same thing to other customers. This company continues to send erroneous collection letters to me and other customers stating that they are behind in their loan payments and that they are in default. I paid {$3700.00} and received an exemption of {$120000.00}	1
they send out a third party to 'look over ' records on the internet. In no way does XXXX XXXX have time nor the funding to pay their staff to look up each CB investigation for verification. I was also told they are like a library that archives court filings ONLY	1
they send us a packet saying they want to help us!!!! Now	1
they sent XXXX document that conflicts with all of the attached records. I have no explanation for this document. However	1
they sent a letter dated XXXX stating that "" we are unable to adjust the terms of your mortgage through the Home Affordable Modification Program because you do not live in the property as your primary residence. '' I NEVER lived in any other location since the condo was purchased XXXX. The 30 year mortgage at 7 5/8 % originally obtained in XXXX has NEVER been modified and remains at the same interest rate. After an extraordinary amount of work submitting applications	1
they sent me a check for funds that SHOULD have been applied to principal and reduced the interest charged to me. They refuse to acknowledge their error	1
they sent me a full bill for internet with charges for a full month of services with them ( XXXX XXXX ) and a bill for XXXX XXXX. XXXX I had bundled with XXXX	1
they sent me a letter apologizing for their mistake. Their business office	1
they sent me a replacement card with a balance of {$55.00} on it? ( still owe me {$190.00} on that XXXX ) then my sister was able to use hers for {$110.00} until it was compromised and a thief stole the rest of the funds	1
they sent me loan information which I attached indicating I was 0 days delinquent and paid yet reporting differently to credit bureaus. I sent the same to credit bureaus and they still validate the information being reported? I have attached the most recent letters but I have been disputing the same for months and had an Omnibudsman involved named XXXX XXXX with the U.S. Department of Education	1
they sent me written correspondence that my dispute of this account "" appears to be duplicative '' and a notice that reads	1
they sent to do an appraisal ( twice )	1
they sent us into foreclosure. We got the run around on the amount we needed to send in. We finally got a letter from the attorney stating the amount owed via a certified check. I took the check to the attorney in person and received my reinstatement letter. The mortgage company has not post the funds to the account	1
they sent {$1800.00} instead of {$280.00}. XXXX	1
they set it up on an automatic payment system to hide	1
they set up a suspense account without telling me and while my statements from Chase said they received my payments	1
they shifted the order of my transactions ; my biggest transaction was on Monday	1
they should be able to correct the mistake on the same day. So	1
they should correct the address they have in the system	1
they should give a consumer reasonable time to research and consider and offer in writing. Not fair to attempt to upsell HARP rates after making the offer two days later. Very dishonest and put good family 's under pressure.	1
they should give me a car worth the amount they taken from me. I do not have the car! They keep resubmitting the same paperwork threw the court	2
they should have calculated our tax payments correctly to arrive at a more accurate payment. It seems that they did not include insurance in their escrow calculations either	1
they should have qualified individuals on staff to determine if the appraisal they are considering is appropriate. First	1
they should have the divorce decree. I did not receive any further follow up phone calls or emails to notify me of the results of the search. I called again on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and they stated they still did not have the copy of the divorce decree so I faxed over the copy to the fax number that they provided me. I continued to call to verify they had received the document. I was told that it takes time for the bank to receive the information and then update my account. I called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and was told they still had not received the divorce decree. They gave me another fax number which I faxed the document to. I called on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and they confirmed that the document was received but it takes 7-10 business days to update my account. I called again on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
they should honor the {$200.00} they promised me. It was the the bank 's fault	1
they should not be deceived by these large companies. I did n't choose OCWEN ... ..my mortgage was transferred there. The company is OCWEN Loan Servicing	1
they should not hold money that is not theirs.	1
they should notice me that before my request on that regards	1
they show hazard insurance as {$1300.00} when it is only $ XXXX year and was aleady paid by me in XX/XX/XXXX and not due again to XX/XX/XXXX. This error causes them to hold an excessive amount of my money in an escrow account. Furthermore	1
they show that I can not pay that amount every month	1
they simply postpone the deadline. I finally drive to a storefront Chase Bank who then says they are going to overnight me my title. I received this letter the next	1
they simply sent me a letter that they had already sent me on XXXX XXXX. They did n't even try to correct this issue. I 'm reaching our to you all before I sue in court. This is costing me money because my interest rate is higher because of this. XXXX score is XXXX points less than my other XXXX scores and its all because of this erroneous reporting. They are breaking the law by reporting erroneous information according to the FCRA.	1
they sold the default loan for mere pennies on the dollar. Seterus has not taken any responsibilities for this property. It has been broken into and had illegal squatters creating crime for the neighborhood. Seterus is happy to just sit on these loans. However	1
they sold this invalid debt to another third party collection agency	1
they somehow were able to get my new number. The statute of limitations has long past and I 've told them directly that I have no intention of paying them a dime. Checking their record on 'reverse yellow pages '	1
they spoke to us in a condescending manner and tried to make us appear stupid. We were told that they could not provide us with a payment booklet that would allow us to show how much of our additional payment should be applied to principal and escrow. In fact	1
they start calling me on the XXXX of every month and call every single day numerous times. They also call my wife 's phone number even though she is not listed on the credit application. They call from several different telephone numbers and will discuss the debt with anyone who picks up the phone. They have talked to my wife	1
they start with "" this call will be monitored for training and security	1
they started calling my house all day long again. I had to turn off the answering machine.	1
they started charging {$15.00} for checking accounts. I have not noticed the charge until XXXX XXXX. My account was charged {$160.00} in fees during the period between XXXX and XXXX XXXX. I approached a banker with last name XXXX at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX branch ( XXXX ). She refunded {$40.00} but she said she needed authorization to refund the remaining {$120.00}. Then she modified the account and the fee was waived since XXXX XXXX. In XXXX XXXX	1
they state that both accounts are to remain in my report until XXXX	1
they state that the last payment I made on the account was XXXX XXXX	1
they state that they want us to pay XXXX per month instead of XXXX on top of the 15% of wages. We cannot afford this. We can afford the payment	1
they stated I was correct they sent the wrong modification agreement and advised me not to return it. I should not be concerned and a new agreement would be sent in the next 5-7 days. Last Saturday I received a notice from an attorney about an eviction. Now again today someone has showed up at my door with an urgent notice and taking pictures of my home.	1
they stated XXXX dollars! The contractor stated that they would send a crew out to start the job in a few weeks! A few weeks later	1
they stated that a check would be sent in 10 business days. I waited a little over two weeks to check the status of the refund	1
they stated that my account was approved for a trial modification. I stated at that time that I had not requested nor agreed to any changes to my mortgage terms. I asked that they immediately correct the credit reporting. I was told that this would be corrected. Since XXXX XXXX	1
they stated that on XXXX XXXX	1
they stated that they may still go forward with a foreclosure. I can not understand why they would give us until XXXX/XXXX/15 to close on the sale of the home	1
they stated the physician	1
they stated the unpaid debt was bought by Cedar Financial and they control the settlement offers. The XXXX representative stated they have no more interaction with account due to Cedar Financial purchasing the bad debt. I am concerned that the collection company is not only trying to collect the wrong amount but also presenting misleading information. I was also able to print my statement from the university which shows the original amount was {$1500.00}	1
they stated they "" would remove the debt that is not mine if she paid the balance ''. So she did	1
they still are making the claim that I breached contract but have since "" waved '' the fee to a breach of contract and refuse to acknowledge that I was never under said contract ; I believe they have used this play on words to try and create confusion and twist the issues at hand.	1
they still claim that this request is still processing after almost 9 months of my disputing. Please note that both XXXX and XXXX are accurately reporting my legal name. Whereas	1
they still had no new information to give me. I called again on the XXXX of XXXX to try and illicit a response regarding this issue. Exeter informed me that a second paper-check was mailed out on the XXXX	1
they still have n't gotten back to me. I called them and asked and they said they do n't have a number to their dispute department. How is that even possible? How am I even suppose to know they 're looking at it? They would always tell me they 'll call me but never did. So I am hoping that by this complaint	1
they still have no clue.	1
they still have this report on my credit report	1
they still honored fake checks and the signature is n't even mine. Someone at this bank messed up or they do n't have a good fraud detection process and they are unwilling to help me.	1
they still refused to give me the remaining {$100.00}. They stated that they placed me in a separate promotional offer with a lower APR	1
they still refused to take care of this. I disputed with XXXX and XXXX ... .and Associated/ Elan told them the lates are correct even with copies of my checking where this is deducted. I need these lates removed immediately. It is hurting my credit score. I need this removed from all XXXX credit reports. They are reporting to each c bureau that I have been 30 days late for these months and then at the bottom it shows XXXX a month payments for these months. I am trying to purchase a car. Thank you for your help.	1
they still reported it to the credit bureaus and have affected my ability to acquire a mortgage in the short term. This is a shady business practice. Debts whose ownership is not confirmed and verified via a SS number or other official means should not be allowed to be reported.	1
they still show that I am dead	1
they still stated they were unable to work with us and only referred us to a credit counseling agency. Until then	1
they still wo n't tell me why they are calling. This has been going on too long and each time I block their number	1
they stole {$150.00} from my bank account on XXXX. I called and they said they would just take {$50.00} out on XXXX for a total of {$200.00}. They did take {$50.00}	1
they stopped it well before the allowable limit of how long I can still legally pay XXXX Loancare. When I finally found out	1
they stopped taking payments and said nothing to me. I became concerned that a large payment may be coming so I called them and was told there was a problem with the way they took money	1
they stopped the correct versions of the statements. I finally stopped calling them after a year 's time and looking on line for help. Please help!	1
they submitted the same account against my credit. Guess the vultures forgot they had already submitted it in XXXX. I have printed my credit report and submitted it to an attorney proving what I am saying is true and I have the phone number stored in my cell phone showing that the real culprit in this scam is Commonwealth Financial and bogus name NE CRDTCOL. I am informing CFPB just to make you aware of this fraud on their part. I have also written to all credit reporting agencies to check the original debtors on the reports and submit them to me to t urn over to the attorney involved. I have had enough and was informed of steps to take against these debt collection agency agencies. This debt happened back in XXXX and is just now being placed on my credit report. The real issue is it was paid and my insurance company will have records as well as the original debtor. I intend to sue Commonwealth financial and this bogus name NECRDTCOL to the fullest extent of the law.	1
they substituted the phone numbers of the thieves for my contact telephone number into my personal information XXXX. This was just descovered in XXXX while monitoring my credit reports. Finally	1
they suddenly raised the mortgage payment to {$2700.00} claiming that they mis calculated the escrow. That took six month for me to get XXXX XXXX XXXX to admit and issue me the opportunity to go through a XXXX modification. Only one month through the process they sold off the loan servicing to Seterus. Now Seterus seem to be blocking my loan modification process	1
they suggested I put my loan in my last economic hardship forbearance around XXXX ( 6 months of no payment ) I agreed. The next month I got another bill. They said they back dated my forbearance and I still would need me to pay for the rest of the loan	1
they suggested that I take out a loan against my XXXX	1
they switched my account over to Specialized Loan Servicing LLC ( "" SLS '' ). SLS was supposed to give me back a {$5100.00} dollar overage in my escrow account that they inherited from XXXX XXXX XXXX. They sent me an annual escrow statement that was supposed to have a check attached. There was no check attached. I called them. They said they were putting a stop payment on the check. After waiting and waiting	1
they take months to get it done and hurts your credit.	1
they take that as an okay to run your credit. The only thing I was doing was trying to get my profile as updated and completed as I could.	1
they tell me I can no longer get the used XXXX I wanted due to the LTV and would have to get a new Altima. At this point I had to get back to work	1
they tell me that the money I just sent can not be used at a first trial payment	1
they tell me the account number that is on my credit report for them is in fact NOT my account	1
they tell me they will "" reverse it '' and it should be reflected on my next statement. But then the cycle repeats. I make a payment they either "" did n't receive '' or it 's applied too late and yet another late fee is applied. This happened for months and months and months on end with both Capital One accounts. I notified them in writing and also contacted their fraud department to complain	1
they temporarily froze my account which reversed the payment to Barclay once month. I received a payment confirmation and no word from Barclay that there had been an issue with payment via email or mail. In XX/XX/XXXX	1
they then paid the taxes	1
they then said they would need a letter from the reporting firm. Typical catch XXXX there is no winning. Even though I disputed the info with XXXX it has not been removed.	1
they then sent a copy of the closing documents to carrington	1
they then sold or transferred the loan to XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
they then state that they are not sure why my loan is showing in that status.   I don't mind getting help but no one and I mean no one has been able to explain to me what the issue is here.	1
they threatened me. "" Then suffer the consequences! '' And	1
they told her they were a tax accounting firm and had nothing to do with cars or car loans. When my wife called the XXXX number	1
they told me	1
they told me "" the only time they will consider to help is when my loan is at a default. '' I was up to date with all my payments at the time and did not want my credits to be affected. I continued to call and received the same answer. I finally defaulted on my loan after taking out cash from credit cards	1
they told me I could no longer pay them	1
they told me I did have one and that I could have gotten a cheaper plan with them.. But it was too late as I had already agreed to a plan from XXXX XXXX.	1
they told me I was in foreclosure and I would not be eligible for the program unless I it was 24 months after the program that I had	1
they told me how much to pay off the loan	1
they told me it would be easier to take $ XXXX out. Not knowing anything about college and loans	1
they told me me I could do again but needed to pay more {$4100.00} certified	1
they told me that I had 30 to 45 days to provide them with the proof of insurance.	1
they told me that I had a {$90.00} payment in XX/XX/XXXX. How could it happen with a closed account? If there was a pending payment	1
they told me that I should be able to do so as long as LTV is XXXX %	1
they told me that I was approved for a deed in lieu	1
they told me that because I signed a financing agreement with my lease	1
they told me that the machine would not return any money and that the amount of XXXX dollars would be credited to my account. I did not think much of it and believed it to be a ATM error that had been resolved with this call. On XXXX XXXX	1
they told me that the settlement amount is {$660.00}. so even the letter shows more money that I need to pay. I am not sure why all these conflict of information.	1
they told me that they had closed the account incorrectly. The manager was not in	1
they told me that they sent XXXX check back to owner and that he put a stop payment on the account. so they charge me XXXX fee and XXXX for my account being over draft. they said that I have pay them the money or the friend that sent check have to pay them. this was from my local bank of American who I talk to one of local manager at the bank.	1
they told me that they will not be reissuing a second check to them in that amount since the check has already been cashed. Today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX I spoke to a supervisor at Convergent Outsourcing Inc. XXXX XXXX and she acknowledged that they received all payments from XXXX our credit consolidation company and that XXXX submitted the proof they required that payment of {$110.00} was in deed paid to them. They can not locate the payment themselves. There is no problem with XXXX because they have the proof that the payment was made to Convergent Outsourcing. Kindly help us to have our account with XXXX XXXX to be cleared once and for all. XXXX XXXX still has our account as unpaid and that we still owe them {$99.00}. as per XXXX XXXX	1
they told me the only thing I could do was pay the outstanding bill for a month of service and then they could come out for a service call. They have since sent my account to debt collection. This does not seam fair as I never had working service from them	1
they told me there was nothing i could do. This account on my credit is holding me back from so many things and i just need help getting it off please!	1
they told me they denied me because I had no credit history.	1
they told me they did n't like the tone of my voice and may just keep it on the IT list to call. I do talk loud XXXX but is that a reason to use such tactics against people who they know do not owe the debt? So not only are they breaking the XXXX no-call laws ( because they know the debt is n't mine ) they are harassing me in attempts that I will strong-arm my brother-in-law. What they are doing is not only wrong	1
they told me they did not have any information on me and could not discuss the loan and until they had the information there would be no discussion. I called Suntrust and spoke to XXXX. XXXX	1
they told me they had not turned my check request in and I needed to order them again	1
they told me they looked it up on public record. I told them it was XXXX	1
they told me to call the insurance company. Later they left me a message saying they called the insurance company. I have still have not rec 'd the difference in any form of credit or refund.	1
they told me to use the old card at an ATM. Only after that failed as well did they tell me that the card had been disabled. They were only willing to waive a XXXX fee to send a card in 7-10 business days even though they mislead me	1
they told me to write a different check for the amount of my shortage for my impounds account	1
they told me via email that the deduction was for a "" wire payoff fee. '' The Note I signed on XX/XX/XXXX and the Federal Truth In Lending disclosure I received on the same date clearly state that the loan had NO PREPAYMENT PENALTY. I view this {$15.00} as theft from my escrow account	1
they told my I had to have the PMI for 11 years ( 132 months ) and that there was no way around it. My challenge is that I was told something else and my loan documents say my term is 92 months max.	1
they told them that we were a month behind. This caused us to incur late fees. They seem to think that XXXX can fix their mistake. XXXX CAN NOT FIX A MISTAKE THAT BENEFICIAL MADE! Beneficial needs to be held accountable for stealing a customer 's money. This is a heinous act and they need to be punished. After many requests they sent us their accounting records of our mortgage. THEIR OWN RECORDS SHOW THAT THEY MADE A MISTAKE IN APPLYING THE PAYMENT TO THE CORRECT MONTH. Apparently no one at Beneficial Customer Service can read and understand English. Nor can anyone decipher their own accounting records. PLEASE make every effort to find someone at Beneficial that can read and understand English and can also understand their own accounting records. I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR THAT THEY BEAR NO RESPONSIBILITY TO FIX THEIR MISTAKE BECAUSE THEY SOLD THE LOAN TO XXXX AFTER THEY STOLE OUR MONEY.	1
they too did not give me the reason and they claimed that they could not disclose such information. As a legitimate customer / consumer I do feel that I have a full right to know what did I do wrong to be dropped out from PNC Banking services	1
they took care of it by marking it paid and thats not what they explained at all. and then they threatened to put the new debt collections on the credit report if we did not pay them. Which is not mine to begin with I know that debts are to come off after 7 years and unless they were removed	1
they took monies from my account ending in XXXX	1
they took {$740.00} out of my account every other Friday ( the last time being XXXX XXXX	1
they transfer me to XXXX.	1
they tried to cash my check. I am sure they had it all along. For my XX/XX/XXXX payment I did an EFT payment through my bank because I was afraid to mail it after the XX/XX/XXXX mess. Now they say they do not accept EFT payments	1
they turned me down XXXX. Started a XXXX with a agency here in Michigan	1
they turned my account over to a collection agency. Their actions have hurt my credit rating and are heavy-handed and unethical. I do not believe the bill is accurate and I do not believe I have an obligation to pay.	1
they turned the debt to a collection agency ( DCI Collections )	1
they use Synchrony Financial. Around XXXX XXXX	1
they used a name that I stopped using after my divorce from my first wife	1
they used false and misleading numbers	1
they used the XXXX on XXXX XXXX	2
they used the wrong website ( XXXX	1
they waived my XXXX processing fee. On XXXX XXXX	1
they want the buyer and me to incur the costs of replacing the check. The level of incompetence is astounding. At this point	1
they wanted a new P & L	1
they wanted checking and investment account statements for post closing	1
they wanted to see documentation of the sale of my previous property which I had no problem providing. I provided the deposit receipt	1
they wanted to talk to the immediate supervisor ( which is myself )	1
they wasted my time and now I still have to pay for something that did not benefit me at all. They just took my money. And I want it back because I still want to go to a reall college.	1
they went all-out and their main focus was to harass and belittle me- They called the references on my application repeatedly -not just to leave messages for me but they continuously harassed them with multiple daily calls - leaving very detailed messages even told my son I better call them because of the delinquency and car was going to be repossessed	1
they were Balance Billing me. Their fees did not match my insurance company Explanation of Benefits. This was very confusing and would have cost me much more than what I owed. On XX/XX/XXXX they billed me {$2300.00} for the XXXX performed XX/XX/XXXX. A final notice was received XX/XX/XXXX. During the whole process I got harassing calls XXXX harassing calls during XX/XX/XXXX. Since XX/XX/XXXX I have paid them {$3400.00}. Of the {$2300.00} only {$1700.00} remains. A check for {$300.00} was mailed XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX CSR XXXX pressured me by saying I needed to pay the {$2300.00} within 120 days for it would go to collections. I advised him I agree to pay what I owe but I was neither informed of this procedure and in no way understand why I 'm being pressured even-though XXXX XXXX XXXX has been receiving constant payments from me. They followed through on their threat. A letter from Automated Collection Services XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
they were advised not to call me by phone and in writing. Location purposes do not hold water here considering they spoke to me and verified my information.	1
they were all the same. My realtor used the software from XXXX right after we listed it to get it approved for a short sale. Well	1
they were almost doubling my payments on the fixed account and NOT applying the {$35.00} on the XXXX deferred which put the accounts behind	1
they were applying the payment to the previous month. My bankruptcy was discharge in XXXX XXXX with all of my account current. However	1
they were denying me the loan. She stated I would receive some written letter. In a letter dated XXXX XXXX	1
they were even higher again from what XXXX had said the second time ... Wow I thought. I also call the next day or so and asked to speak to a supervisor regarding this loan officer. I wanted them to know that they had someone working for them that I believe would mislead someone else and I did n't want that to happen. I spoke to superv	1
they were filing papers to take me to court	1
they were forcing me to pay interest on approx {$2100.00} that I had previously paid off before the end of the introductory offer. I can not believe that this is legal and think Home Depot is fleecing their customers. Please advise if this practice is in fact legal and what I can do about it. Thanks	1
they were going to send the police to my work	1
they were not reviewing the file for assistance. We asked if the calls are being recorded and she said yes. She again stated that they will not review the file for assistance because the sale date is less than 37 days from the date they received the request	1
they were not very helpful and told me to file a dispute with the credit bureau which I did and won and it was taken off my credit. However	1
they were obligated to reverse the credit issued barely a week ago and charge me account again. I demanded for a copy of the said regulation they purportedly were bound by in their relationship with XXXX. They could provide me none!! Instead	1
they were paid for services that I had and billed me for {$500.00} of equipment but stated upon received they will remove it. As of today I am obviously being billed XXXX for something that is not mine as I do n't have any account with them anymore. Why would XXXX years later something falsely like this appear on my credit report.	1
they were reporting it as an active mortgage with a balance of {$120000.00}. I contacted them via email requesting that they provide me with the XXXX. They followed up with a XXXX showing no interest paid XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Senator XXXX XXXX 's office and they sent a letter on my behalf. Once again	1
they were scanned in at the XXXX XXXX hub	1
they were still asking for information. The final straw was when they started asking for 2014 taxes ( for the XXXX time ) and then asked us to "" explain '' my husband 's first job out of college ( 30 years ago )	1
they were told XXXX to leave it in XXXX account status. The fact that they had no idea where it was supposed to go was incredulous! That 's how the conversation with them began. Do they think I 'm moving money around only to later figure out what to do with it? I took steps to get the money out. About the time the money was to come out	1
they were told the debt does not belong to anyone at our number	1
they were unable to apply the XXXX miles.	1
they were unable to explain the criteria and wanted me to pay {$15.00} to accept my payment over the phone. I requested a Supervisor/Manager and they disconnected me from the line. My loan is not late	1
they were very nice saying they had a whole department to help people like us and they would work with us to give us a loan modification.	1
they will call XXXX and hang up when they get voice mail	1
they will claim they did not receive the payment and I tell them I have my statement in front of me. That clearly states they took money from me. After they harass me over the phone	1
they will contact me. There has been no contact & I have not received the Equifax report I requested as of today -- XXXX XXXX. When you call this company 's number	1
they will continue with the foreclosure sale date. I consider this dual tracking and extremely unfair business practices and in violation of CFBP rules. Is there some way to ecourage them to continue with the short sale offer review. They have been sitting on the offer since	1
they will forget to release any liens because they have n't demonstrated an ability to adequately service the loan.	1
they will have earned additional interest and almost two years of monthly late fees that could have been avoided but/for its delay. The practices employed here by Chase are deceptive	1
they will just deduct that money from my account they are forcibly closing and then send me the remainder. US bank had restrictions and a hold in my account where no deposits or deductions were to be made	1
they will just have me listed as XXXX time additional when in fact they left all the XXXX cards listen on my report and just saying that I was terminated.	2
they will not allow me to access the money in the account	1
they will not apply my mortgage payments. This was the original complaint against them that has not been resolved as yet ( please refer to complaint # XXXX ). I do n't know what to do. I was instructed by Wells Fargo NOT to pay my XX/XX/XXXX taxes since e they erroneously paid them and are still working on the file as to why they paid the taxes again and why the escrow account was not removed after it balanced out to XXXX liability on my part. I apologize if this is n't making complete sense but I am so frustrated and scared about this and feel powerless to control what is happening.	1
they will not be able to sue me again	1
they will not even return phone calls	1
they will not give me my XXXX XXXX form ( even with the XXXX SSN ). I immediately sent them a scanned copy of my SSN	1
they will not mail it ... .then stated that it would be XXXX per page ... I agreed but they never sent anything. I am receive XXXX per month	1
they will not work with me to establish a reasonable payment plan for my current income. Further	1
they will not. The only written correspondence we receive from them is our annual escrow analysis	1
they will place an stop paymen t in such a check and issue a new one. So far I have not received the check	1
they will receive over $25000.00 for a vehicle that was originally sold for less than $13000.00.  I do not believe that I should have to pay this additional cost.  They did not add the interest to my payment history	1
they will take until the following Thursday to credit my account. This goes on even though I get bi-weekly deposits from XXXX	1
they will try to harasse you into making a payment over the phone which is a XXXX fee then they will tell you that they will waived the XXXX fee but they do n't	1
they will try to pin it on me. I 'm just starting to get myself back in ; the good	1
they wo n't help at all. Please pull those calls! Half those people should be fired. I asked XXXX extremely antagonizing guy what his name and id number was and he refused to give me either! Someone please help me with this! It has to be illegal to send something to collections after TWO WEEKS FROM THE PURCHASE DATE. The bill shows a due date of XXXX/XXXX/XXXX! I could potentially be out a lot of money if this is n't fixed quickly. The company refuses to help me. They just gave me a XXXX to write to in XXXX	1
they wo n't remove the information on my credit report being reported in their name. They will only tell me it was sold to CBV Collection Service XXXX which only goes to a busy signal everytime I try to call. I do have records of this number calling back in XXXX. Again last payment history XX/XX/XXXX should have already been long off my credit report and no legal liability existed due to statue of limitations at the time XXXX sold the account showing on my credit report ( only XXXX of the XXXX ). I feel TransUnion and XXXX XXXX XXXX could have fixed this and if issue of this reporting is with CBV Collection Service then fraud in re-aging the account. I found a CBV Collection Service online with a different toll free number based out of XXXX with complaints and actions against it but not one answers even though says business hours. When I discovered this error several years ago ( disputed 7 times so far over 2 years )	1

they would agree that it was paid off. This went on for several months. Upon viewing my credit report	1
they would apply that toward the delinquent payment and I would be current. I have been making payments on time for two and a half years but have n't been able to accrue enough money to make a whole payment that would bring me current.	1
they would be able to locate this information by my name. Search by my name and address and was unable to find an account. I requested that this information be immediately removed from my credit report since it was false and they were not able to validate an account. She asked that I call back with the account number. I filed a complaint with the XXXX explaining how Trident reported an account on my credit report in XXXX 2015 stating that the account was opened in XXXX 2015 and that I was never contacted by this company in writing or by phone. I was never given the opportunity to validate the debt before it was reported to the credit reporting agencies. The dispute was not resolved until XXXX. The result of the dispute per XXXX XXXX	1
they would be charging me interest and penalty fees. I just would like my refund now. Thank you.	1
they would be reducing the amount we owe on our house. They also said they would be giving us better terms for our mortgage. Since we have been paying on our mortgage for ten years and the principal has not gone down at all	1
they would call me back hours after to continue the harassment. It is very stressful and causing so many issues in my life. I have advised them that this is harassment and they can not legally do that. If I missed the payment	1
they would change the customer service representative and the new one will ask for everything again. This has been going on since XXXX	1
they would change the terms and tell me I had to pay additional money or pay this or that	1
they would clear my credit bureau of the collections as well as contact the original creditor	1
they would correct the account once the payoff was received. I continued to check daily and there was an overage that was due to me as well. After the payoff posted on XXXX XXXX ... I contacted Capital one again. They submitted the dispute on my behalf and it was denied. I asked why and explained what I was previously advised when contacted. There was no concern. My account was never paid late during the two years I had the loan and I would like for the XXXX to be removed from my credit report. If that was n't the case	1
they would get their payment on time. Well	1
they would have also noticed the fraud alerts. By not sending me information and giving me the chance to dispute they took away my rights under the FTC 's FDCPA	1
they would have been unable to charge on the pending POS charges.	1
they would have levied everything i have	1
they would have received payment. The money was on file with the court and was disbursed to another creditor because of their error. The lender is now holding me accountable for their negligence ; and I am being told that there are no options for me to work out a plan to keep my home.	1
they would ignore my request and process the check. Since the check in question was {$6600.00}	1
they would lower the rate for the time I would be gone. After sending the orders	1
they would n't be able to give me the loan. She said that on the loan my father had that I had said I would make the payments in which some payments I did make for my father then he finished making payments to eventually finish the loan out but in no way was I tied legally	1
they would no longer help me on the phone	1
they would not allow me to do so. When I asked for the telephone number of the automated payment	1
they would not allow us to speak to this legal dept. Each time there was 2-7 days between their receipt of the fax and response from the legal department.	1
they would not be releasing my {$4000.00} escrow account balance for 30 days. That is totally unacceptable to me.	1
they would not budge on the appraised value. After going back and forth and asking for the dispute denial in writing in turned out that Wells Fargo never sent the dispute letter to the appraisal company. After speaking to the appraiser again	1
they would not even pick up the phone	1
they would not fix the problem	1
they would not help. I was able to pay them off in XX/XX/XXXX by then the amount was {$8200.00}. I was charged for {$3000.00} for property insurance and county and city taxes although I did not own the property	1
they would not lift the restriction. I made the final payment on XXXX and on XXXX they charged a {$3.00} monthly fee with a XXXX minimum interest. I called and was again told that they would not lift the restriction and that I could keep paying the fee	1
they would not release where they obtained my personal information. Now I have received a letter from the XXXX stating that my driver 's license is revoked!	1
they would not talk to me because I am not officially their client XXXX Suntrust is XXXX. My question - is it legal for Suntrust to obtain a non-cancelable PMI on my behalf from XXXX and not refund the unearned premium when PMI is no longer applicable? And how could I have avoided pre-payment of un-cancelable PMI?	1
they would of repossessed my car. I believe another issue at the center here is that I was offered a "" loan extension '' on the back-end of the loan as a "" special offer '' to customers like myself in good standing. This was encouraged/offered to me on the phone by a First Merrit Rep back in XXXX well before loan maturity of which I took advantage of but that I would have to pay some additional interest at the end of the loan by doing this. I paid that interest and its documented. I did receive a letter of the offer but no specific details of the offer in writing or informed by anyone at First Merit Bank on a monthly basis when I called to make my payment that this would put me in a "" delinquent status '' or "" affect my credit report. '' nor did I receive any written notification outside my statement in good standing that my "" loan was in jeapardy '' outside of the additional interest that was due from the extension of the loan. Each month I called in on the due date and make a payment and the First Merit Bank reps were pleasant and informative on any questions I asked. Last week I called First Merit ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) to address the credit reporting errors after "" repeated attempts '' this past year to resolve with "" notorized letters '' and "" attempts to remove '' the errors. I spoke with all three credit reporting agencies who said they would submit inquiries to the bank -- most of which was not done and the tone was very clear that the Bank is always right. I received today ( XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ) upon my request a "" history of payments '' from First Merit and asked for both due dates and payment dates to verify the so called 5 separate months of 30-day late payment. The multiple sheet shows nothing of the such to support their claims of 30/60/90 or 120 day late. I 'm requesting all 30-day lates be taken off my credit reports as well as 60/90/120 day which are not acurate and was even told so by First Merit Bank Reps/Supervisors - XXXX and XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. Additionally	1
they would only let us talk to our account representative	1
they would only take a bank account payment so I have to wait for them to send me a paper statement.	1
they would only tell me that they were with IC Systems and that they were calling about a "" business matter. '' When I asked what the "" business matter '' was about	1
they would pay the taxes and give us an additional payment to the mortgage payment. When the payment was returned for insufficient funds	1
they would properly apply the amount to principle	1
they would realize I am not "" XXXX XXXX '' and XXXX is not his number.	1
they would release provisional funds to my account. They released the provisional funds for the first claim. When XXXX weeks went by and I had still not received the provisional funds for the 2nd claim	1
they would talk to me in a rude manner asking me to fax my infos ( such as social security card	1
theymust specify the item that was missing or incomplete.	1
theyshould be investigated	1
things were ok for a while but as school started to get more demanding I could not work as much and my payment plan with the school started to suffer. Because	1
thinking I was paid in full six months after my XXXX ended. XXXX XXXX	1
thinking my daughter or mother was in danger ... .everything would be fine. Upon finally reaching someone with XXXX who could pull up my account	1
thinking they are gift cards	1
third party	1
third party about a debt I owed to a company. This person was not listed as party to the debt so I 'm not sure how Admin Recovery even got their contact information. When Admin Recovery called the person	1
third that my credit report from the credit agencies was not favorable in order for them to do this. I forwarded another letter to the bank 's representatives and explained the situation and was contact by XXXX XXXX XXXX who advised me to forward the remaining documents for financials and that was done in XXXX. At that time I was told by her that I would have to continue the process all over again even though it was handled poorly and improperly by the bank. I told her that I should have to do this	1
this 1 % fee has cost me over {$100.00}.	1
this XXXX	1
this account does NOT belong to me! and needs to be removed.	1
this account is under dispute by consumer and reinvestigation is in progress. When a investigation of an account is in progress and a consumer is disputing an item on their reports	1
this account may not even belong to me.	1
this account was opened in XX/XX/XXXX. I 'm not sure how they were able to add this to my credit report with the Account Opening Date of XXXX. XXXX XXXX has called me a few more times still trying to collect the debt. They were also using scare tactics stating that they were going to submit this debt to the other XXXX credit reporting agencies even though they are aware that this is a fraudulent debt/account.	1
this account was opened on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX XXXX stated that {$920.00} was outstanding on this XXXX account. I spoke with XXXX 's Fraud Department and they have no record of this account or of selling this account to Midland Credit Management. XXXX XXXX XXXX an account manager at Midland Credit Management would not provide me with additional information on this account and informed me that I would need to file a police report in order to resolve this matter. I then went to my local police department and filed an identity theft report. I called Midland Credit on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX XXXX again and he insisted that I owed {$920.00} to his company. I informed him that XXXX has no record of an account being set up in my name. I asked him who his company bought this debt from and he stated	1
this account was opened on XXXX XXXX	1
this address is the parking lot of a XXXX XXXX XXXX building. I requested a phone number for this bank	1
this agency has violated the FDCPA.	1
this appears to be a fraudulent statement. Any one or any agency can submit an invoice of this nature to a consumer demanding a payment from a company. For example	1
this bank do n't care about it 's customers.	1
this bank never took into consideration any of the extenuating circumstances of our situation nor did they consider the facts of the matter. They looked at the numbers provided and took nothing else into consideration including the fact that if we were able to refinance or modify this loan to reasonable P & I loan we would be able to easily afford the home the we live in. Instead they would rather watch as it goes into foreclosure. Peoples Bank is very difficult to deal with I have found this out through the years of dealing with them and I would like to find another option to rectify this situation. I am currently researching other options but I was told I should file this complaint anyways so that the incident was at least reported as another predatory lending operation gone awry. Thank you	1
this being back on XXXX 2015	1
this billing and threat of action resembles phishing.	1
this by itself is not a hardship ; the fact that she suffers XXXX however IS very difficult. I am also in the remaining six months of a bankruptcy	1
this claim has not been removed from my credit report. I called State Collection again today ( XXXX ) and spoke with XXXX	1
this common practice for them. I 'm not asking for the fair overdraft charges back	1
this company SLS increased my monthly payment again it then went from XXXX to XXXX plus an additional amount of {$270.00} per month. This amount is not adding up unless iam paying double and triple for escrow. Iam asking for this to be resolved please.	1
this company did not report to the credit bureau our earnings sent since XX/XX/XXXX. Reporting just started a month or so ago and the second loan still is not being reported. Since they became my servicer I have been loyal and pay every month on time without late entry`s and this is how we continue to be treated. Ocwen promise to send a explanation in writing explaining what happen in why they failed to report to the credit bureau	1
this company has charged over 200 % in interest. This year alone	1
this company has left their home alarm service in my home of which they refuse to pickup and i am being charged for it and 5 years of service this is extortion for such a system and a 5 year contract at first i was OK but now after experiencing their customer service and that the collection agency is arrogant against me i just want this all to end and my credit returned and restored before them. under the Federal trade comission this is a XXXX fine that they should be fined for sending me such paperwork but i want the federal trade comission to contact the credit bureaus for what they said under my multiple disputes to have this removed and then contact the debt collector and fine them so that they cant lie about what was sent and communicated to me.	1
this company keeps calling us and sending bills even though we have done what they asked of us	1
this company ran my debit card for {$28.00}. I notified the above individual and after giving him my name	1
this company takes any additional money I mail in for my mortgage	1
this completely relegates or negates XXXX and the XXXX credit agencies as a basis of judgement for credit. Again	1
this could have been your money but no you was being smart well at least you thought you were being smart. Now you have to get {$4.00} or {$5.00} dollars a month for as long as it take to pay you. I had not plan on doing this but you caused all of this by the fees the Bank was charging me every day your debit came through my account. This is all your fault. I never would have done this but you made me do this by trying to be smart by running your debit through my account every single day. Now you have to suffer like me until I can pay you your money. I feel I owe you nothing because of all the money you caused me to have to pay my Bank. The money I had to pay the bank was just ridiculous it made no sense for you to run your debit through my account like this but this is what you wanted to do so suffer like me.	1
this creditor "" XXXX XXXX XXXX "" did not file a lien against the workers compensation case to get paid. I gave them all the information and yet they did not file a lien and said they have no one in the office that knows workers compensation procedures. I even sent them the forms to file a lien and told them when the case is closed the insurance must pay them before the case can be closed. They did nothing and now they are coming after me for their incompetence. They insist that I must pay and threaten me with legal action	1
this creditor sold the account to a collection agency AFTER the bankruptcy discharge. The collection agency ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) continues to contact me illegally.	1
this debt appears to be past the Statute of Limitations so it meets all the criteria to be removed. Just because someone opened an account with my personal information	1
this debt is 10 years old	1
this debt is not mine.	1
this debt never even showed as a viable debt to the credit reporting agencies	1
this debt sits on my credit score. It gets updated every year	1
this debt they are attempting to collect is beyond 6years the statute of limitation in Pa where I reside	2
this did not happen. This represents a pattren of abuse and fraud by this company that Must be haulted.	1
this document was not recorded until XXXX XXXX	1
this drug in XX/XX/XXXX and were we given several conflicting reasons why.	1
this employee had similarly called all of her friends	1
this endless investigations time goes on.	1
this error had to do with our insurance impound account. First of all we were told while doing the loan that the amount of insurance needed to be increased to XXXX in coverage. I offered to contact our agent to discuss this. Quicken insisted they needed to contact our agent. Meantime we never heard anything additional while the loan was in process	1
this fee. In this circumstance US Bank has declined even after multiple attempts to credit this fee despite it being charged due to bank error. This is a predatory fee that is being charged in error and must be credited.	1
this happen during the end of the month when I have to pay rent. They keep telling me that they can not give me a time frame on how long it will take but keep guarenteeing me the money is safe but mean while my car insurance was just cancelled XXXX 2015 and the bill collector will not take an excuse I have suffered severaly from these damages and lost out on a home	1
this harassment is causing me anxiety from last 4 months	1
this has been a nightmare	1
this has been a very lengthy process	1
this has gone on too long and believe that something should be done. The reward points is XXXX thing but the extra charge that has been on my account for almost three weeks is another.	1
this has negatively affected my overall credit score	1
this has not happened. I attempted to follow up on this request by calling customer service and was placed on hold for 45 minutes with no response.	1
this has reflected poorly on me	1
this has to be an internal problem in equifax to change status and in addittion the other XXXX credit report companies are reporting correctly	1
this home equity loan was originated by XXXX mortgage then sold to XXXX then acquired by XXXX XXXX XXXX and then eventually serviced by XXXX Servicing. Other entities that contributed to my misfortunes included a financial counseling agency and a law firm that took a lot of money from me ( with large up-front fees ) without assisting me in any meaningful way! Lastly	1
this included several XXXX way calls with both companies reps. I have also made a couple of visits to the bank and spoken with the manager ( who by the way is short with me	1
this information	1
this information MUST be up-to-date an accurate	1
this information is causing great harm to my profile	1
this information is difficult for me to understand	1
this information is incorrect. I would like to have this information validated and for the information removed from my credit reports until it can be as I have no idea that this is even my debt to pay.	1
this information should of been disclosed to me as a consumer in the purchase. I tried in vain to take the vehicle back to the dealership and was deceived several times. I simply can not afford this vehicle. It will probably be repossessed.	1
this is XXXX of the reasons to apply for a modification. XXXX Mortgage Modification	1
this is a VERBAL CONTRACT WITH AMERICAN EXPRESS!!! I immediately spent the {$2000.00} and after a few weeks noticed	1
this is a clear UDAAP violation in the following ways : ( i ) it has caused a clear financial injury to me as a consumer	1
this is a common problem that many people have encountered. Later that day	1
this is a fraud and its happening with many clients	1
this is a legitimate debt that I need to pay. I owe nothing.	1
this is a notice sent pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act	1
this is a practice that has affected XXXX XXXX customers. I never pay my mortgage late in 10 years. They are predators. Transition should practice better due diligence and look further into the documentation sent by consumers	1
this is affecting me and my finances.	1
this is all the money we had to survive on for a whole month. My husband does not owe MCM any monies	1
this is all the money we had to survive on for a whole month. My husband does not owe XXXX any monies	1
this is an apparent case of tax fraud	1
this is an outright intended and deceptive	1
this is costing me interest with the account that I am trying to transfer.	1
this is costing me money in interest on my loan. I would not recommend Bank of America or any FHA loans to anyone.	1
this is discrimination by a bank claiming to be Equal Lender	1
this is fraud	1
this is how we found out that our loan was transfered	1
this is hurting me! good bye kohls..	1
this is irrational & harassing as I am up to date on payments. When I call their XXXX number to get to the bottom of this	1
this is law ). So	1
this is my ex husbands debt. Several request via the phone and in writing have been sent to this company to validate this as I do not recall ever obtaining only my ex and this company has never once responded back providing me a signed initial contract with my signature. I have disputed this account also with the XXXX major credit agencies which they have all stated they verified which how are these companies able to verify when I can not. I am lost for words as I can not move on with my life with this old debt which I do not believe I am responsible for is listed that I owe. Does n't a company have to have proof/validation of a signed initial contract and prove that it is within the statue of limitations? I do not know where to go from here I am asking your agency to help me as your company helps consumers.	1
this is my livlihood! I do not feel like an investigation was even conducted. This public record item is ruining my life I am only XXXX years old	1
this is not acceptable and they must take the direct actions to remove accounts that were not on my record before as well as remove inquires which are not mine. I would also like them to open accounts which they have closed. My credit needs to be a XXXX or higher now and because of this it has dropped Equifax needs to fix this now.	1
this is not even a debt	1
this is not how the offer terms are written	1
this is not my complaint. I see a broader issue here where banks can extend people 's refinance dates in order to potentially earn extra income from the existing loan ( given they continue to hold the original loan. ) I have no recourse. I complain but ca n't be refunded for the two extra mortgage payments I have paid and the {$800.00} in higher interest I have had to pay. Industry wide this practices costs consumers significant sums of money. I would love to work on an industry panel or regulatory body to fix this issue. Possible solutions could be a limited timeframe to complete a loan after which the bank will pay the difference in interest owned. Thank you for your time	1
this is not the case. Chase only used expenses relating to my husband and myself and thus came to the determination that we make too much money and denied our short sale. We have escalated this case to the CHASE executive office. The people who have the offer on our home have extended their offer until XXXX XXXX. Our loan is a USDA backed loan	1
this is not the original lender and it has been changed during the length of the loan a number of times without my consent )	1
this is not true. XXXX XXXX/FMS Financial Solutions had my information and permission to withdraw funds directly from my account on a monthly basis. However	1
this is ridiculously high.	1
this is something all credit companies should provide for free since a consumer is entitled to XXXX credit reports a year.	1
this is the XXXX time that this debt collector violated my consumer rights under the FCRA.	1
this is the date they bought the debt. I have requested debt validation many times	1
this is the first time I have received a collection notice on this amount and have not received any information on when the service was/if it was provided by the Hospital they are collecting for. They want me to send in a payment and then discuss options? It does n't even give the date of service..	1
this is the last tim this is gon na happen l just sent my employer my new direct deposit info which ive had the account all thr time. Why did you have to change banks? For whatever reason it was to benefit you and not the consumer	1
this is the reason my online transactions were denied and a replacement card needed to be mailed. My son	1
this is to complicated	1
this is unacceptable ... DO SOMETHING OR IM LEAVING RUSHCARD	1
this is unacceptable.	1
this is unfair. I have previously had XXXX XXXX XXXX information verifying this is my account. I have asked Wells to state what amount triggers the Hold and I was informed they can not disclose. So basically	1
this is very shady practices and should be noted as a possible habitual offense.	1
this is well beyond XXXX days after XXXX started furnishing negative information in my credit report without my knowledge. This is a clear violation of regulations. ) The due balance was also being misstated. I have tried to get the record straight multiple times and no official verification or proof of documents come from XXXX and still my credit report keeps getting the bad end. I demand full deletion of credit line from all credit bureaus before I commence the legal battle on this.	1
this is what we 've done	1
this is wrong and I believe illegal as it violates Respa Reg X- Regarding timelines for reviewing someone for foreclosure assistance	1
this is wrong. They made a mistake and they know it. Now also	1
this issue was entirely manufactured	1
this item was re-age to continue reporting in XXXX.and last but not least	1
this letter has also been written to dispute the claim that we owe {$10000.00} on a "" XXXX mortgage ''. At no time did we sign any documentation for a "" XXXX mortgage '' through XXXX or Bay View. The claims by Bay view that we owe money for a "" XXXX mortgage '' are FALSE.	1
this letter is to file a complaint regarding the handling of this matter by both Barclay 's Bank Delaware and XXXX XXXX.	1
this loan became null and void and no other lender should have been collecting any further debt related to this loan/debt. Countrywide Home Loans failed to get a valid Assignment prior to their bankruptcy. The Specially-made Assignments by XXXX XXXX by Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX are recorded at the XXXX XXXX Recorder Office after the foreclosure sale	1
this loan has been an interest only loan so the principal amount has been about the same throughout the last nine years. She then went on to tell me the 20 year amortization is actually based on 12 years. I questioned that since the statement says it 's based on 20 years but she said the calculation was fixed at the time of origination and that would have been the payment if we had started making the 20 year payment at the time of origination. That does n't make any sense and is misleading. There is still 21 years left on the mortgage and basically no principal has been reduced so 20 years should be 20 years and not 12. I think their making excuses for a glitch in their mortgage statement and instead of admitting it was an error they 're trying to say 20 is actually 12 years.	1
this loan still makes no sense because I am certain that had we only paid {$8100.00} to our principal balance in 23 Years	1
this loan was sold erroneously and there was NEVER a loan that should have been processed. I do NOT owe {$65000.00}. I want documentation stating those facts along with a written guarantee that this will NOT be reported to the credit bureaus. After numerous calls speaking with reps AND supervisors	1
this loan would not defer and had no forbearance options. For a new XXXX student	1
this may be a case of identify theft. '' They are saying this previous address ties me to the account even though I have not lived there in over 30 years. The problem is	1
this meant I was never properly notified of the problem. Should I have been notified of this bill and the impending credit reporting I would have paid it and avoided any credit reporting or continued collection attempts. I remain adamant that their failure to notify me in any capacity	1
this notice includes : Identification of the specific information being disputed : XXXX	1
this now included. I want them to be looked into and to cease and desist so that they do n't try and con any other people!	1
this now makes us unable to get any kind of gov't assistance ( HAMP ect. ) because they say our mortgage originated after XX/XX/XXXX. If we had known that refinancing back in XX/XX/XXXX would preclude us from any further ( and much better ) gov't help later on	1
this number is not in service. Then today my sister-in-law called to.tell me that they are getting calls from same number and same person named XXXX. I do not give my brothers phone number to anyone. I also will say I have had many medical bills go to collection due to my XXXX and inability to pay them off within 120 days. I also have a very poor credit score as a result of my medical bills. It is very upsetting that a company continues to call after I told them to stop. I have via XXXX XXXX XXXX been able to add this number to a blocked caller list feature they offer. But the calls still come from XXXX exchange with different last XXXX numbers	1
this number was given to me when I called to request a rescission of my foreclosure. We applied numerous times for a loan modification with Wells Fargo Bank without any results. Months would go by without any response from Wells Fargo wherein	1
this overdraft status was resulted by the charges that the bank was order to refund me ( there was {$14.00} charged four times ) and the account was n't closed properly. I feel that it is unfair that they charged me with unfair charges to begin with	1
this payment has not posted to my Barclaycard account. My bank account has been debited for the check 's amount. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has provided me with a copy of the front and back of the check	1
this payment is not due until XXXX/XXXX/16. The other son immediately contacted said company. He was informed that the payoff was processed as a regular payment	1
this payment went through Sallie Mae 's own internal payment system over the phone. When she indeed checked	1
this person CLOSED my account. I have repeatedly called capitol one and they say i have no money left on my secured account. When I look I have $XXXX available credit. They WILL not give this money back to me. I have statements saying I paid that $XXXX and the statements show that I should get that $XXXX back. Capitol one more or less says sorry about your luck. Now every single month they are charging me late fees and the account has been closed for months. They will not listen. The $XXXX on the account should have what is owed deducted and the balance sent to me.  I have all the paper work to prove what I am saying is accurate. They are crooks and NOW I closed every single account I have with them	1
this person did not respond to me. I was unaware that my bill was reported to a collections agency and since Stellar Recovery reported this to my XXXX credit report	1
this problem delay a instant request for my line of credit. Also the last person called me was rude and scary. DO NOT OWE THEM	1
this process took almost 4 months to complete. Finally it was done and I was guarenteed to be paying a certain amount every month for my PITI. I spoke to a supervisor	1
this rationale was also not provided to me until 90 days after I had set up an account with above the minimum required {$20000.00} and also set up my direct deposit service. I am in disbelief and anger that an institution could be so blatantly deceitful in their banking processes.	1
this section of Maryland Code : MD Comm L Code 12-109 ( 2013 ) What 's This?	1
this should never be allowed to happen! How can a bank place a block on your account without even attempting to contact the person firs or at least having the decency to keep the department open long enough to resolve the issue! I asked the supervisor XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) to give me someone else who could fix the issue	1
this should not have gotten past me. So	1
this supposed to be a VA loan	1
this time I wish to do everything in my power to stop XXXX XXXX from harassing those who have loans taken over by them.	1
this time including the check	1
this time the bill had the new account number. I called Macy 's back again on XXXX XXXX	1
this time to Lustig	1
this time with her card. When it came time to pay the monthly bill in XX/XX/XXXX	1
this time {$19.00} plus a {$100.00} late fee & interest	1
this too was a waste of time and money. We decided to re-finance XXXX. The main reason was that their office was in the same shopping center as my hair salon. So if I had a problem	1
this transfer failed. When I logged into my online Citizens Bank account to pay a bill	1
this type of loan is equivalent to the pay day and or car title loan. I vaguely remember reading the government has passed or is contemplating passing legislation to prevent companies for preying on customers in financial distress. She said the interest is compounded daily on the unpaid loan. On XXXX occasions I encountered financial difficulties and deferred the loan. Unbeknownst to me they charged me XXXX the amount of interest which resulted in additional {$2400.00} in payments. I asked the representative how much I would save if I paid the loan off. My current interest rate is 10 %. She said I would not save a penny because they have already added the interest due to the type of loan. Can a finance company legally charge over {$300.00} in interest in one month? I am confident XXXX of Americans on a daily basis are paying a high interest on a simple loan due to lack of knowledge. I would not have selected this type of loan option. I relied on the expert knowledge of the loan officer.	1
this was XXXX 2012. I never once received any correspondence indicating there was an issue until XX/XX/XXXX when it mysteriously showed up on my credit report as not being paid. I contacted them directly and they investigated and wanted me to fax them a receipt	1
this was after she showed no record of me submitted records back in XXXX XXXX. She told me to try email for faster service. I told her I emailed in XXXX XXXX and it is XXXX and I have not gotten a response. She told me to send a letter	1
this was in XXXX of 2015. I can not recall the amount	1
this was never explained to me either by the dealership nor by the Bank. I believe this is very misleading	1
this was not an easy decision.	1
this was not brought to my attention ( the cardholder ) for XXXX days. Conviently enough for them	1
this was not carried over like it should have been. Now I am faced with an almost XXXX dollar homeowner 's insurance bill that is due in a month that I was obviously unprepared for because I thought that my mortgage company would continue to put aside money in escrow for it.	1
this was settled out of court with myself not owing any fines or fees in relation to any of their accusations. Ocwen needs to follow up on this and retrieve the money that they paid the condo association and apply it to my mortgage. If Ocwen followed through on this my mortgage would be paid in full and I would no longer have to deal with them. Ocwen is threatening to foreclose and sell my property without even attempting to settle all my issues. Again	1
this was the biggest mistake I have made in my XXXX years. While I currently have a decent job	1
this was the first I had heard from them. If they had called previously	2
this was when we were only XXXX months late. Please do something about this company and their lack of consistency and harassment.	1
this week i will mail you all the info	1
this will be easy to prove.There should be no reason for other reporting agency to obtain the accurate information while equifax cant? This info continues to be reported incorrectly and now should be removed because of the failure to properly report it	1
this would be a great way to assist with his care.	1
this would be the second attempt to try to resolve this hardship. I do n't understand why they have scheduled a sale date for XXXX XXXX	1
this would get sorted out with the dealer and that my account would not be reflected as & gt ; 30 DPD and would not be reported to any of the credit bureaus. For an additional 1-2 weeks I continued to receive harassing collections calls	1
this would not be a problem. However	1
this wrong statement. According to Federal Housing administration "" one of the requirement can remove the FHA mortgage insurance based on new appraisal of the property ''. Now the value of our house is approximately {$10000.00} ( XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX thousands ). According to Wells Fargo we are not qualified to remove the FHA mortgage insurance and the appraisal will not be taken into consideration. Wells Fargo is wrong. I have the documents that I can prove that wells fargo doing is wrong	1
this young kid was not only rude	1
those XXXX agencies ' employees were sleeping when collecting my information from my creditor and failed to notice my SSN number on the reported credit info. Second	2
though I did not want XXXX. I do not understand why my modification request is being denied. I make {$66000.00} a year plus have {$16000.00} in rental income. I filed bankrupcy and it was discharged in XXXX 2015	1
though I eagerly anticipated purchasing this vehicle I stopped hearing from XXXX.On XXXX XXXX	1
though I made a payment of XXXX $ towards my principle XX/XX/XXXX	1
though I only have to pay {$500.00}. I just want to remove my father as a cosigner. They are factoring in my car payment	1
though apparently I was denied for a loan modification. To further compound the matter	1
though different states	1
though it was faxed multiple times	1
though it was slightly later in the month than usual. I have a few rental properties. XXXX separate locations each have their own U.S. Bank mortgage I have owned both for many years.	1
though my return number was verified during the call	1
though not quite as frequently as it has of late.	1
though the account was closed! It was a small amount	2
though they still did not apologize for unlawfully removing money from her account. I feel that I am being intentionally harrassed because I filed a complaint against Capital One.As of this writing I can not get through to a human being.	1
though. We owed them less than {$300.00}. When I called them	1
threaten	1
threatened and harassed comptroller and contacted the undersigned using the foulest of language	1
threatened or laughed at. I do not like the deceptive practices when I have attempted to work in good faith with this debt collection law firm	1
threatening	1
threatening and vague. When explained that there was no difficulty in paying the debt once we had received verification of their company	1
threatening collections and demanding that they make a payment and threatening default - this happens every single day even on weekends though they never call my phone. I call them several times	1
threatening foreclosure	1
threatening leagal action against myself if I do n't respond : by various debt collection Agencies	4
threatening to "" Contact the DA and to have legal and criminal action taken against me ''. I paid another amount and got a receipt	1
threatening to foreclose on my property even after they have been paid and ask that my mortgage been sold to another more professional financial institute.	1

through all of this I have been receiving harassing phone calls	1
through email and through regular XXXX mail. I have not heard anything and it has been over 45 days since those forms were sent. My entire family lives in the home and needless to say I am NOT comfortable not being able to pay the mounting balance that is occurring. I am saving all that I can and paying the utilities. I am unable to log into my SETERUS account online	1

thus	2
thus I called them again	1
thus Scottrade 's boilerplate use of previous correspondence for materially new disputes is inappropriate.	1
thus allowing {$2000.00} in merchandise to be charged. I discovered this upon receiving the card in XXXX	1
thus because I did not issue ( another? ) later payment for XXXX	1
thus causing XXXX to perceive that we still owed them usage charges. After receiving numerous billing statements from XXXX ( even after trying to resolve this issue over the phone	1
thus causing the negative item to remain with Equifax longer.	1
thus could no longer afford financial obligations I could afford while working. I contacted my creditors	1
thus covering the check. The check to the IRS bounced	1
thus leaving me financially responsible for both cars. They denied ever telling me that I would n't have to pay for the damage on the car and since leaving there I have been unable to get a hold of the XXXX	1
thus not correcting the mistake. Tired of dealing with them	1
thus the financial responsibility has been his. Recently he also filed for Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy to which creditors XXXX XXXX and XXXX are listed. This was finalized and payments are being made by him at 100 % payback. I am requesting that these debts be modified in the 3 major credit bureau databases to reflect that I am not liable for the debts. At this time	1
thus violating the FCRA and I 've sent letters in an attempt to have the account removed from my credit report. Captital One no longer owns this account and according to Texas State Law	1
ticket number XXXX - {$54.00} and ticket number XXXX - {$83.00} all together came up to {$190.00}. On XXXX/XXXX/16 this agency attempted to collect again {$54.00} for the same ticket number XXXX and {$10.00} for the same ticket number XXXX all together {$64.00}. When I contacted them to tell them I noticed they are trying to charge me twice for the same tickets they said if I can send them proof that I did sent the {$190.00} ( even though they knew well that they cashed the check ) they would rectify. I did send them proof from both my bank and I. Today	1

In checking the .gov relative to the modification I found that BOA was not supposed to have reported me as delinquent. I would like for you to handle this before I need an attorney.

I have been back to work and perfectly capable of making my mortgage payments for over a year now. One of the XXXX numerous ) reasons I 've been denied is that I ca n't afford to pay my mortgage. I now have 14 months of mortgage payments saved up that the bank wo n't accept.

I now have 14 months worth of proof XXXX not XXXX that is required ) that I can afford to pay my mortgage.

to loss of funds for what can be a considerable period of time if there is unauthorized use ( because of the way that the banks drag out investigations ).

On XXXX/XXXX/15 we received a letter in the mail dated XXXX/XXXX/15 stating that our account continues to be past due and that we would be reported to credit bureaus if we do not pay the outstanding balances immediately. Representatives from the customer service department on XXXX/XXXX/15 stated that the letter was sent due to the erroneously applied XX/XX/XXXX payment and that the timeframe for reversal of the payment and correction of the issue would now be 35 business days.

I panicked for a moment. I asked what is it that I have to do to stop the foreclosure. XXXX informed me that I had to fill out a Loan modification packet. I did over a dozen of Loan Modification packets. XXXX informed me that I was denied a Loan Modification because I was not residing in the house which the utility bills had the address of the estate. By that time XXXX had sold there Company to XXXX XXXX. Then we had to start over again. At that time I had all the documents XXXX XXXX XXXX requested at that point XXXX and XXXX XXXX was at fault for over charging minority. Then XXXX XXXX XXXX sold there Loans to Greentree. At that point I had to start over again they did not have any documents from the previous Companies. How can you determine if my mother owes on a loan if you do not have any documents that I summited. Well after I summit all the documents that greentree requested. Greentree always said that XXXX document or another. I played alone with that game for about two years then Greentree informed me that they was merging with DiTect at wits end.	1

verified my information.I also asked if I could make payments to them instead of the debt collector. She said I could and that they would report my payments to Reliant. I proceeded to call Reliant back. I asked to be directed to a supervisor and the call continued. I spoke with a supervisor named XXXX. I told her about the prev. calls she said it would be looked into and went on to continue to try and collect the debt. I told her that XXXX stated I could make my payments to them and they would report my payment to Reliant. She said I could not do this and my payments must be made to them. I wanted to take time to figure things out but I kept getting told that if we did n't reach an agreement right now that it would be a refusal to pay. We came to an agreement of {$58.00} a month and I would try to payoff the balance in full as quickly as I could. So in summary I feel like I was bullied and pressured into paying this company. They were not professional at all. The whole call was handled very badly I believe. Kinda felt like I was tricked into paying them. I have no problem paying this debt off. Had I known about it before I would have taken care of it but between the time I stopped going to the school and now I had moved a XXXX times and had my number changed. So this was my XXXX time hearing about it. They stated they had called multiple times before and have left voice-mails. I do not recall any of this and to my knowledge I have never received any calls or voice-mails from them. I feel like I should have had time to go over my finances and figure out exactly what I could pay XXXX month but as stated before I was getting told if I did n't reach an agreement with them right then it would be a refusal to pay. And from what I have heard from other debt collectors	1
verifying that I only have XXXX credit card account with them. I faxed this to Transunion who stated that this new item would be reviewed within five days and a determination made.

was able to determine that the reason my payment was not due for another month was because the amount that I had been paying to have applied to principal had instead been placed in suspense until it equaled a full payment amount then being credited to the account as a payment. Her resolution to help make up for the fact that I had been treated so poorly was to leave the payment date of XXXX alone and take a payment equal to the amount that I had a history of making on time ( which she was also able to confirm that the payments were made on time ) and applied it in it 's entirety to the principal of the loan. Today I called Chase to see if another issue that I am facing would affect the method of how I pay my loan. Initially the call started with the normal verification and the agent on the phone was able to provide me an answer to the question I had called for. This is where things began to go drastically in the wrong direction. I told the agent on the phone that I would also like to make a payment since the loan was due today and I had her on the line. She stated to me that my payment was not due until XXXX. I stated to her that she was not correct and that the last payment was taken an was to be applied to the principal of the loan repeatting the information above mentioned.

I called our county government to find out if they had in fact received any money from Ocwen for back real estate taxes and why. They lady I spoke with had no idea what I was talking about because I was never late on paying my real estate taxes and not owing anything. I then called Ocwen again and told them of my encounter with our county government and claimed they did not know who was paid this money. After weeks of speaking to people from XXXX and trying to understand them I finally spoke with someone who could speak understandable English and he explained that Ocwen had paid my condo association that money because of an invoice my condo association had sent to them stating that I owed them money for fines and fees associated with me alter my condo. This was in litigation at the time and no settlement had been approved yet. Ocwen knows this and still will not acknowledge that fact.	1
was contingent on 2.9 % of the total balance. I 'm now aware of the miscommunication and cleared late charges and brought my account to balance. Ther contingency is : there are no late fees	1
was deceived Suntrust bank ; because of Suntrust 's actions	1
was declared exempt and my Statement of Intent declared that the property would be retained and that I intend to "" Continue to make monthly payments as they become due	1
was denied	1
was discharged of my debt including my XXXX mortgage. I have not heard anything from my XXXX mortgage in years. This past year I grew tired of my delinquency status- I have decided to short sale my home and relocate my family to another state upon closing using the HAFA program. This is where my problem begins	1
was due to the fact that U.S. Bank was in the process of being investigated by regulators	1
was enacted "" to ensure that	1

was forced out of my home for the second time ; by which XXXX XXXX	1
was foreclosed on in XXXX XXXX	1
was given XXXX	1
was given a temporary debit card	1
was given by my husband. I then replied no XXXX other than myself can give a creditor permission to access my credit file. I asked for a supervisor	1
was granted permission to garnish me. In fact	1
was included. So the trustee sent them small payments throughout my plan. In XXXX XXXX the loan was paid off	1

was not allowed to access my account on XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
was not applied correctly. call several times daily to case manager	1
was not available so i was hooked up with agent XXXX who told me it had to be a mistake	1
was not considered late until the XXXX so we set it up on the XXXX. It was taken out this way for years. The mortgage was sold to Green Tree Servicing ( now XXXX ) back in XXXX of this year. I called them and asked if I could set the mortgage payment set up to be auto drafted on the XXXX as we had done with XXXX. They said that would be fine. I asked if the payment would be late	1
was not even done or the card was not in my hands or I did not recieve it at that time of this issue.	1
was not informed until XXXX XXXX ( thru an automated email disclosure ) of this reduction in loan to value. She was negligent for not timely informing me of the reduction in LTV and trying to push the loan to close without properly informing me. Please see details below : On XXXX XXXX the process officially began by submitting an application thru their online system.	1
was not sure why the option was in the menu	1
was offered and that I accepted. I had to base my acceptance of the mortgage modification based on the TPP 's information which only contained terms for programs that I did not qualify for and the total trial payment amount.	1
was offering the same degree	2
was one of the 3 trial payments of which I phoned in XXXX	1
was only worth a little over XXXX dollars in XX/XX/XXXX	1
was over talking me	1
was overdrawn for less than a few hours.	1
was paying XXXX and has jumped to XXXX XXXX my payment effective XX/XX/XXXX.  I cannot make this payment.  I have tried to ask for help with my XXXX mortgage directly	1
was put on hold for prolonged periods of time and transferred to multiple people and no one would give me straight and truthful answerbabout why my accounts were closed. Finally	1
was rejected by multiple people at the organization.	1
was reported to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The collection account was subsequently deleted by all three credit reporting agencies due to my complaints of HUNTER WARFIELD/JEFFERSON XXXX never providing the requested proof of the debt	1
was requested multiple times. HOW COULD THEY PROCESS THE LOAN WITHOUT THE APPLICATION? A web site to follow this modification	1
was responsible and has been making the insurance payment for the last several years.	1
was setup to be paid with an impound account through my mortgage. For some reason the mortgage company did not renew my insurance account and therefore it was canceled XX/XX/XXXX. When I went to refinance my home this year	1
was stated soon to be a floor of {$500000.00}	1
was that I was not the first person to have been deceived in the process of trying to get to my PayPal account.	1
was that they were still pursuing payment because the information I sent was insufficient.	1
was the lender requesting tax returns for separate entities that we did not receive compensation from. Since our annual income was consistence and 80 % of the amount of the loan request	1
was the loan processor	1
was to get some short term help and US Bank has in no way made any attempt to help us through this. They have placed us in a very difficult position and only seem interested in putting us into foreclosure to take our home. That is the "" threat '' they have stated in the communications multiple times. We feel helpless and do n't know who or where to turn to try and get someone to listen and / or help.	1
was to monitor my account	1
was to redeposit that XXXX money order back into my personal Wells Fargo account for the remaining balance of {$1600.00} for the next service agent 's survey.	1
was told 3-5 business days it would be fixed. Received a letter stating an inability to honor my request. Was contacted by the individual my report was merged with informing me our reports are still merged and that they received my personal credit information along with theirs.	1
was told the account would be closed. The next month I received another Statement showing I owed the {$50.00}. I called again on XX/XX/2015 and spoke to XXXX who indicated that even though I was denied credit through XXXX XXXX	1
was told the amount owed and began making payments immediately. This was all done over the phone and I was given no documentation from anyone at the time.	1
was useless. I would call XXXX or times a week and get no return phone calls. So after I signed this new paperwork	1
was valid. Review Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Case # : XXXX. I want Wells Fargo Financial National Bank to issue me a credit of {$4000.00} and send me a new card as well.	1
was verbally abused by the collectors	1
was very unhelpful	1
was withdrawn from my bank account causing an overdraft charge. On XXXX XXXX	1
wasting my time again ). please try and help. I am mailing some of the papers I have sent them certified mail but will send you any thing i can	1
wasting one hour. Citibank should send me statement every month and give me a chance to mail check to them.	1
way more then should have been. He then towards the end of the call says he could n't help any further and i got back what I needed to get back. Then he proceeds to tell us XXXX still on conference call ) that I would have to contact the pay off/customer service number and they will further help me. I basically stated that the pay off/customer service could n't be the same and I do not!!!!! want to start all over again there was and extension given but when I turned around to proceed to call the given number in fact it was want I guessed it would be all over again with customer service so i decided to ask for the pay off dept to discuss my problem and according to her she like says ca n't get ahold of pay off then do not have direct lines	1
we	1
we 'll be with you in XXXX minute '' responses. Nothing was resolved.	1
we 'll remove you ''.	1
we 're being charged XXXX half payments in our second paycheck of the month in spite of already having paid the first and second half-payments this month. This is n't due to any delinquency on our part. We 've been excellent customers	1
we 're entered into a modification "" trial period '' and we begin to receive delinquent payment and foreclosure notices. We call immediately in fear that we are going to lose our home	1
we 're told conflicting information. Meanwhile	1
we 've made a decision to close your account above ''. This was a total surprise for me.	1
we 've never had a problem. After numerous dead ends and roadblocks	1
we ( WF ) noticed there was an error in the "" Year to Date '' summary section on your billing statement. '' The letter goes on to state there is no action required by me ; however no where in the letter does Wells Fargo explain exactly what the "" mistake '' was	1
we DEMANDED that the installer apply a waterproofing material to the underlying cement board before installing the tiles. After the installation process was completed	1
we add together the daily balances for all days inthe billing period and divide this total by the number ofdays in the period. This gives the balance subject to theinterest rate for the billing period. "" Adding together my daily balances = {$8100.00} / 31 days in billing period = {$260.00} ( bal sub to interest rate ) 1. 15.24 ( interest rate ) / XXXX = XXXX. XXXX x XXXX = XXXX. XXXX x {$260.00} = XXXX. XXXX / XXXX = {$3.00} interest for that statement. ( I was charged {$4.00} ) Statement XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX : Daily purchase balance subject to interest rate is XXXXfor all days not listed	1
we again submitted a full and complete package using a XXXX Label provided by Wells Fargo on XXXX/XXXX/2015. We have called repeatedly	1
we agreed I would pay {$280.00} ( the {$270.00} plus {$5.00} in interest ) and Macy 's would reverse the {$25.00} late fee they had charged my account. I further requested my account be closed.	1
we agreed to pay them anyway as soon as we got our refund gift visa card from XXXX between the end of XXXX to the end of XXXX. They keep harrassing us for the past several weeks with daily phone calls by demanding full payment immediately. We have explained our circumstances to them 2-3 times	1
we also sent COPYS to Att. Gen. As well as our local district congressman	1
we are an "" entitled party '' by being a successor trustor through foreclosure. The fax documents were sent to WFHM per instructions received from a representative and subsequent calls have been made as well to no avail.	1
we are both XXXX. AES claims that I 'm basically stuck with repaying the loan. The percentage rate is very high at 9.493 % which is above the original rate I was given. This company refused to provide me with the bank information associated with this loan which was initially XXXX Bank. Thank You	1
we are contacting our attorney and filing lawsuit. I want Citibank to cease and decist all collection attempts for this now alleged debt	1
we are current with XXXX and have no late payments. The second lender Suntrust was more difficult as they only offered to transfer the entire balance to interest only. for the past 3 years the interest only payment was {$110.00} and we would pay {$200.00} monthly. Today XXXX/XXXX/XXXX we received the monthly statement and the payment has increased to {$400.00}	1
we are divorced	1
we are expected to pay {$4900.00} up front. We started working with XXXX XXXX in XXXX 2015. XXXX XXXX promised in writing a 1 % rate on all CC transactions and 0 % debit card transactions. It was never disclosed that we would be working with another company ( XXXX XXXX ) We were also promised a XXXX machine that would be compatible with quickbooks for accounting purposes. We were sent a different model of key pad	2
we are here today at almost the very same issue with Bank of America ... .We were notified by Bank of America XX/XX/XXXX that in order to apply for Modification we would have to have all papers to them Faxed by XXXX XXXX 2015	1
we are not able to address the matter '' I find it hard to believe that I lost all of my rights under the settlement agreement just because XXXX XXXX XXXX sold the Loan to Caliber. Especially since I received a letter from Caliber on XX/XX/XXXX that specifically stated "" The transfer of servicing of your mortgage to Caliber will not affect any term or condition of your mortgage '' Caliber refused to provide a single point of contact and I spent many hours on the phone talking to multiple people. I was frequently promised call backs from supervisors and representatives that never occurred. I was told my loan was going to be reviewed by a legal department but it never was. My loan was dual tracked while I was applying for a loan modification in direct violation of the court order.	1
we are not protected by consumer 's right of 10 days refund rule. They ever recommended to contact the criminal to solve the problem. I never knew this so called merchant and never authorized any payment to this company. But I still called the number provided by bank. First time they provided the number went to someone 's voice mail with the voice mail was full. Then they gave me another number went through a guy was the previous employee of this company. Say no more	1
we are not sure if this is his real name. He started explaining to us how this vacation club called "" XXXX '' would allow us the flexibility to use our money for a variety of different types of vacations. He told us that he would purchase our XXXX XXXX timeshare and we did not have to cancel. He told us that what we paid to XXXX XXXX would be applied to our vacation club membership. It all sounded too good to be true and as part of becoming members we would receive a two week vacation for XXXX. He wanted us to pay {$8000.00} but we told him that we could not. So	1
we are now at the end of the season and are not sure how we can continue.	1
we are now in XXXX and GreenTree nor XXXX XXXX XXXX has made any effort to assist. Please help. I am trying to save my home. For further proof or evidence my case is under XXXX XXXX and the case number is XXXX.	1
we are on food stamps and Tanf. It is illegal to do this without written authorization.	1
we are out of food and need to pay our bills! It is my contention that wells fargo acted in bad faith and should be justly punished!	1
we are reviewing the foreclosure process to verify no error occurred. The new expected date of resolution is XXXX XXXX	1
we are still reviewing our call and payment records to determine if refunds can be issued. We apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused and appreciate your patience. Please be advised your new expected date of resolution is XXXX XXXX	1
we are told it will be 30 days before we see the problem has been corrected. 30 days has come and gone 10 times.	1
we are told letter will be sent. Finally	1
we are trying sell property and we have worked with the lender in every regard. We believe this is illegal because it called dual tracking	1
we are trying to contact you to give you the opportunity to pay before we garnish your wages on XXXX XXXX. I said there is no way you can garnish my wages for any debt that number 1 has been paid	1
we are unable to expedite the process any further. '' I asked "" why not '' and have not received any replies yet. I am exhausted with this process! I have done everything XXXX XXXX XXXX and Navient have asked! I do n't understand why they were harassing me so much about these accounts and now that I 've settled	1
we are unable to locate a valid Gift Card number ''. I called American Express again and was told to contact the seller ( XXXX )	1
we are waiting to hear back from them. Customer service said it would take a couple days.	1
we are well beyond 2 years since the origination. This month XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
we ask to do the modification again and sent everything they wanted and they turn us down saying we did n't send everything again and they were going to forclose on us. at this time we went to our lawyer for help and we hired national support group to help us with the modification. all we wanted was a payment and they ( well fargo ) would n't give us one. national support group said they would be able to get us a loan modification so we sent all the paper work to wells fargo again the same paper work they requested just updated and they turned us down again saying we did n't make enough money so they were going to forclose on us.XXXX talked with wells fargo and found out they were not using all of our income just part of it sowe resmittted all the paper work again for the loan modification	1
we assumed they were credit offers and shredded without opening them.	1
we became late on our mortgage. I turned to Nationstar Mortgage for help to no avail. In XXXX XXXX I hired the XXXX XXXX XXXX to help us get a loan modification. XXXX XXXX was assigned to our case and our loan mod request was submitted to Nationstar on XXXX XXXX	1
we began the short-sale process. In XX/XX/XXXX	1
we believe the servicer and investor had misrepresented their intents and have conspired to abuse the government home retention program as well as mortgage insurance program. We ask CFPB to step and investigate first if the servicer acted in good faith and to see if they have a similar pattern with other failed loans. Time is at an essence	1
we believe your dispute is not valid	1
we believed we would get the promised variable rate. So we accepted the offer and closed on the loan and opened the required checking account and had automatic withdrawals of the payments from that account. During the course of the first year	1
we both on thought it was best to go on Saturday XXXX XXXX to let her know who I was. I asked her to call wherever she needed to call to let them know I was there. When I tried to give her my driver 's license and XXXX card which she refuse to look at them. She was very adamant and told me it was out of her hands.I went back that Monday	1
we ca n't afford a lawyer	1
we ca n't fix it! '' I have spoken to various people in the bank	1
we ca n't to next time it will work ... it has become so burdensome that i 'm willing to pay the {$10.00} to do the lift.	1
we called Caliber to make sure the payments were still going to be deducted automatically from our account and to make sure they had our account information. However	1
we called Chase to let them know I was working again and submitted our paperwork to re-start normal payments on our mortgage. XX/XX/XXXX	1
we called Seterus spoke to XXXX XXXX XXXX Seterus to follow up on the escrow analysis but would not provide any other identification as confirmation of the call such as her full last name	1
we called and spoke with the customer service representative	1
we called back and were told we would have it by XXXX. When we still had not received it by Monday XXXX	1
we can not put her on a repayment plan. We would have to come up with the full amount or HUD will foreclose on the home. This for a balance of {$3500.00}. We have continued to contact them but they do not return calls nor do they seem willing to answer questions. We are reaching a point of frustration and will continue to call but we are afraid that my mom will lose her home and be placed in a long term care facility. We are prepared to send them a {$1500.00} payment in XXXX but we are not sure if the house will foreclose	1
we can recall the account from XXXX XXXX. If you do n't name a new cosigner ... XXXX XXXX XXXX attempt to locate the executor to discuss the status of the estate and the procedures for filing a claim with the probate court where the estate will be settled. The promissory note you signed provides that the loan may be declared in default and due in full if any borrower or cosigner passes away ; however	1
we cancelled the XXXX check and FedEx the XXXX check overnight on XXXX XXXX. Couple days after we mailed the XXXX check	1
we check with someone at Midwest in the department that handles manufactured homes and what is needed for it to be considered eligible property and we had everything that they stated and what is written in their website.	1
we checked it carefully	1
we contacted XXXX and paid the bill over XXXX months ago. We are still receiving letter from Transworld Systems Inc. We would like to complain about Both company.	1
we contacted an agent XXXX XXXX to represent us as we began the process. We also gave {$5000.00} to be held in escrow as our commitment to the home.	1
we continued to pay them our selves. After a year of us being in our bankruptcy beneficial decided to punish us by taking away all of our online access to our account	1
we could get a better rate after a year of making payments. I explained in my first complaint what happened when we tried to pursue that. As for their reply i am listing a few other issues that they raised in hopes that they will finally admit to the many wrongdoings on their part and try to reach some sort of amicable solution for both parties.	1
we could maintain the monthly payments. I also asked for a reduction in the interest rate of 7.999 % that we 've been paying since 2007	1
we could no do it in time to make the closing. I therefore feel that PNC lied to me	1
we could not afford to make the mortgage payments so my father	1
we could not get anyone on the phone or to answer our emails to coordinate the final part of the process. Finally	1
we could settle the whole thing. I had to the end of the month to come up with the money. I called on XXXX XXXX	1
we decided to accept this trial period in hopes of further help in the future. However	1
we decided to refinance on a 2nd mortgage in XXXX with XXXX Mortgage eliminating these debts. Unfortunately	1
we decided to refinance on a XXXX mortgage in XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX Mortgage eliminating these debts. Unfortunately	1
we decided to refinance our house XXXX. We used a company called Residential MortgageXXXX. The company representative who helped us is named XXXX XXXX	1
we decided to seek a short sale. In XX/XX/XXXX	1
we deserve better than this	1
we did n't qualify due to my employment status changing since my loan originated	1
we did not have all the arrears then since my husband was in XXXX. His process lasted until end XXXX and in XXXX they dismissed his case and went back to normal pay by then i had already submitted a workout package to Suntrust. They went ahead and recorded and XXXX and by XXXX NOT even do we were under review	1
we did not identify any unauthorized purchases applied to the account. '' and also "" At this time we have concluded the fraud investigation and consider the matter closed. ''	1
we did not live in XXXX in 2003. I was in the military living in XXXX	1
we did not waive our right to enforce the contract ''. It goes on to state they intend to strictly enforce the contract in the future and threatens to exercise its rights to "" accelerate the debt and repossess the collateral ( the car ). '' This statement is an obvious violation of FDCPA as it threatens the consumer with misleading reporting	1
we did. Finally after 6 months	1
we do n't have home owners insurance currently. We need help from an entity that this company is forced to recognize.	1
we do n't make enough with the new lending guidelines to qualify. It was suggested by our credit union that we request a loan modification	1
we do n't qualify for HARP and I know they have programs available they wo n't tell anyone about.	1
we even paid {$2000.00} to BofA at closing. Our mortgage loan # 's were XXXX ( XXXX & larger loan owned by XXXX ) & XXXX ( second smaller loan owned by Bank of America.	1
we exchanged innumerable phone calls with our assigned specialists XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in order to stay on top of the requests for documentation from us to support our application. Often we were contacted to provide duplicate documents because Chase processors misplaced our fax 'd documents. We even filled out the application twice at their request. It was unclear how long the process would take	1
we face being foreclosed on! We are more than angry! We want US Bank to pay for our delays	1
we faxed and mailed the necessary paperwork on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. To date we have received NO response	1
we faxed the approval to her and then followed up to be sure that they had it. We made a multitude of calls between XX/XX/XXXX	1
we feel that Chase is taking advantage of the situation and will not work with us to lower the rate. Due to the fact that the mortgage is held by Chase	1
we fell behind on our mortgage after I was laid off from work. After going through foreclosure mediation ( read : please move out of your home before we get midieval on you ) we entered into and completed XXXX loan modification programs over the course of XXXX years	1
we fell behind on our mortgage. We struggled to try to stay current	1
we felt completely helpless and at the mercy of XXXX. We can admit when wrong and we were wrong by making only the partial payment late but we were trying to make every effort to become current right away and we were trying to make partial payments to show good faith. Once the legal fees were attached	1
we finished on the building and put it up for sale. We had gotten a buyer and when we went to close found out there was a lean on the building from Capital One for the loan my sister owed	1
we found out that some had different answers than others. At the beginning of this process	1
we found that SPS is reporting fluctuating	1
we found that in addition to the balance of the loan	1
we found that this billing included XXXX XXXX for refueling the car	1
we found that we made {$160.00} too much a year in order to qualify for the loan. The APR for the USDA was 3.875 %	1
we found that we were trying to recoup our monies lost and was contacted by a broker with HFC	1
we gave up and sold our home. SunTrust was paid immediately all back payments	1
we get a different answer where the deed in lieu of foreclosure process is at and no one can tell us what the next step is to complete or what is needed to complete it. They are intentionally trying to delay the process and even an email from their legal office says they are purposely delaying for an unknown reason. Please help. My XXXX year old mother is losing her faculties and health is failing. This predatory and deceitful practice by Financial Freedom is taking its toll on her health and her finances. I have power of attorney for my mother and her estate and have provided that to Financial Freedom already. PLEASE HELP US.	1
we get the same form letter with the same demands every time. Our choice now is to damage our credit or pay almost {$500.00} a month extra in mortgage for a debt that XXXX XXXX added to the end of our loan period.	1
we got a re-modification from Countrywide	1
we got behind on everything	1
we got you NPV positive ''. Our income was borderline "" Too much money ''. The month went by and thinking they were going to help us my CRM did n't call like they said they would and more time went by until they said my documents had expired and I need to send a third round of RMA forms and financial documentation. I did all this and yesterday I received a denial letter. I feel like BofA strung me along so home prices could go up. I would like to know if the department of the treasury saw my recalculated NPV and what happened to all the troves of hardship letters I have sent. Does n't the department of the treasury see the recalculation? MHA and appeals team know that my case was escalated and re-escalated	1
we had NEVER been late so we waited the XXXX months they told is to and called back. We were then informed that we did n't qualify because our condo had lost so much of its value ( {$180000.00} down to around {$50000.00} ) Our next move was to do a short sale	1
we had XXXX modification	1
we had a agreement and he has not given notice of satisfaction for the debt being paid.	1
we had a new baby	1
we had an argument and suddenly he said "" Do you want to hit me? We can settle this outside if you want! '' I was surprised a bank manager would threaten a customer. I ask him to give me the name and tel # of his superior	1
we had been looking at other savings accounts at other financial institutions. This offered the best bonus	1
we had been paying our mortgage every month. Turns out	1
we had double insurance. XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
we had it sitting on our porch for almost two months. l then called and they told me its off your charge throw it away ( dispose of it ) you can listen to their recordings it 's there and i can give the guys name. I repeated him twice. Then he did remove it from my charge. I called to check on it and told the girl I was leary of throwing it out until I was sure it was off. Then she put it back on my charge. Now they are sending me another XXXX tag for the edger and want to get it back. They put it BACK ON MY CHARGE and are ruining my credit. They are now sending me another call tag U	1
we had just sold our house	1
we had never missed any payments and our credit was outstanding. OCWEN Mortgage carried our home loan. After my husband passed away	1
we had to attempt a loan modification. Our loan was sold to XXXX then to NationStar. XXXX DID put us on a trial basis for a loan modification	1
we had to go back and resign a HUD	1
we had to keep submitting repeat paperwork. We were "" on top '' of our application proceedings online	1
we had to pay a .25 % fee on the loan in order to keep our rate locked in. After coming back with the appraisal	1
we had to purchase the home. I explained to him ... as per our purchase agreement	1
we had to push it back in order for no one to get scratched ... signed a loan for over {$11000.00}	1
we had to return the rental to XXXX and pick up our vehicle from dealership. On XXXX XXXX	1
we had told XXXX XXXX we would be making a payment to create a full payment and that in XXXX we would pay XXXX consecutive {$500.00} payments on every Friday to help catch up. This was intended to be XXXX/XXXX/15 - {$370.00}	1
we had tried several times to refinance XXXX mortgages into XXXX ( with Wells Fargo AND other lenders )	1
we have a missing {$10000.00}.	1
we have asked for them to stop harassing us they always get their money it 's never more then 21 days late ( 1 time ) mostly 7 days late	1
we have been denied a loan modification - despite qualifying for a HAMP modification due to XXXX and loss of income. Wells Fargo is XXXX of the XXXX large financial institutions participating in the HAMP program. We do not understand why they are denying us a loan mod when they have received government monies to do just that - modify loans. Please help us sway Wells Fargo into doing what they have promised.	1
we have been harassed by chase numerous times	1
we have been making our current mortgage payments. Because of a reduction of taxes	1
we have been working with a buyer for several weeks that has spent time and money to prepare a bid for repairs for this lender. The value set on my property is for fair market value and my agent has been working to have the value properly reflect the repairs needed. Throughout this process we are all being told by SPS that my property did not have a sale date even though XXXX is publicized for XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
we have borrowed the money from a private source	1
we have different social security numbers and birth dates	1
we have had a number of issues. We recently have undergone a bit of financial hardship	1
we have had two late payments ( missed deadline by 1 day and the latest late payment is explained below ) and have reduced our debt	1
we have heard nothing from XXXX XXXX. We need contact from him	1
we have just come to expect shady business practices and terrible service from this institution.	1
we have letters from them proving it	1
we have never been customers of XXXX XXXX. We do not live in a XXXX XXXX area. None of the false addresses registered with XXXX are the same as ours. We have lived at our current address for 32 years and do not have another address. We have never received a monthly bill from XXXX XXXX. We have never used XXXX XXXX service. This debt is not ours. We will not pay it. XXXX keeps going from one debt collection agency to another trying to collect on a debt we do not owe. While XXXX is the victim of someone else 's fraud	1
we have no earned income	1
we have no food for the week end	1
we have no outstanding debt	1
we have not filed BK. This statement does not include much of the information that Regulation Z requires servicers to report to the consumer on periodic statements. I called Caliber today to ask about this	1
we have not lived at for over 6 years. We put in a forwarding address with the post office and our current address is listed on file with our credit report. The original creditor HSBC has already written off the debt and it has already fallen off of my credit report. I have not seen the collection for the debt listed on my credit report any longer as of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Can they legally file these charges against us on a debt that is almost 8 years old? Is n't this considered a "" Dead Debt '' which in Texas is illegal to collect on? When I requested written documentation	1
we have not received that money.	1
we have received a notice that we owe {$210.00} in account inactivity fees. We called XXXX and informed them we had closed the account two years ago. They say they have no record of that. Now we are receiving collection notices from Glenn Associates Mid-Atlantic	1
we have sent them a payment which I see debited from my checking account and I see in my ditech online account	1
we have sent {$150.00} specified towards additional principal. However	1
we have the same first and last name and different ssn	1
we have to call in several times to fix each issue. We have spent over 100 hours calling into them and they have yet to fix the problem. Their inability to properly apply payments is ruining my credit through no fault of my own.	1
we have tried to block the number but they must be using a different number than what is showing on the caller id ... ..We can not get them to stop ... they call at XXXX XXXX every day	1
we have turned over all contact via email and mail and phone calls to our attorney. We are going forward with a law suit as this loan has been so mishandled and ended up in my family being homeless. This has also been reported to the housing authority	1
we hear NOTHING. They do not respond to us	1
we hired a RE Agent Named XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX to handle and start a short sale. We accepted an offer and now NationStar refuses to accept the offer that she submitted in early XXXX of 2015 and said they will continue with the foreclosure sale. The sale is still set and they wont stop it to process the short sale which is wrong and illegal."	1
we immediately filled out the papers that were attached to it that said we could get Assistance Modification. We faxed the modification paperwork to the number on the notice. After the modification paperwork was submitted	1
we initially requested the amount to be transferred back and it was agreed that the money would be transferred to an account on file	1
we just bought it and we do not have any of that information. '' Since there has been no action on this account for over 2 years should n't it be charged off by now?	1
we just found out that we can not cancel or remove the PMI because our loan process was finalized after the XXXX XXXX	1
we just get a notice that the loan modification request has been denied. They are not very personable and at this time we are in the midst of possibly losing the home	1
we just want our XXXX returned and will never do business with them again	1
we knew we had to show up to closing with 5 % minus the deposit we put down which meant we would need to come to closing with $ XXXX. On numberous different occasions we received a new loan disclosing document - in speaking with our processor	1
we know you 're struggling on this	1
we leased a property in XXXX	1
we let him know we had spoken to his manager who said we would not be contacted again. He said no we did n't	1
we live in Michigan and have a 6 month redemption period after the short sale. We finally rec 'd an offer on the home and now NFCU is telling us they wo n't negotiate a short sale because it is after the sheriff sale ... this make no sense to us because they did n't inform us of this at anytime during the process. We ca n't pay off the loan and really do n't want the home to remain vacant for over 6 months. Does n't the government want banks and credit unions to work with their mortgage holders? Please help.	1
we live in different states	1
we made an extra payment of {$750.00} to go towards the Principal Balance. Chrysler Capital instead took {$390.00} for interest rather than as requested. When we saw this	1
we made several request for a loan modification	1
we may need to pull a credit bureau report	2
we might precede selling our house or applying for Reverse Mortgage Program	1
we moved from XXXX to XXXX XXXX and Honda changed our car payment ( increased it due to taxes ) without any notice to us	1
we moved out and sold our furniture and today	1
we moved to a new city	1
we need to allow them 3 more business days to review our claim and endorse the check. Then they will mail it back to us and we need to allow additional 5-7 business days to receive it. This process which was started on XXXX XXXX with our initial call to the insurance company and has already taken 3 weeks and been extended by an additional 4 weeks because of Seterus	1
we need to let you know that if you proceed with a new Trial Period Plan or modification your existing terms may be impacted. '' I have a very important question regarding this statement and do not want to proceed with the modification application until this question can be answered ( I do not want our existing modification terms to be affected if we fill out and are approved for a new modification ). I attempted to contact our home preservation specialist ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) at ASC for XXXX months. At XXXX point during that XXXX months	1
we need to pick up the floor and underlayment and reinstall everything with the right underlayment. I did n't even counted the precious time I had to spend to arrange everything	1
we never had these false accusations of damage. I thought we were quite meticulous with our move in inspection notes and intentionally noted the carpet condition under "" additional comments '' as we felt it did not pertain to any one category. I will be sure to be overly persnickety in every rental agreement to come now	1
we never received the funds. After XXXX calls to the company in the late-XXXX time-frame	1
we noticed the errors and notified XXXX XXXX. Despite this	1
we notified SPS that under the terms of the agreement	1
we notified Suntrust of their mistake "" took 6 months easy for them to realize their mistake '' they then rebuilt our payment history but never took the Credit reporting mistake off of our credit. Then today	1
we once again contacted WaFed and asked if they would be able to help us modify our HELOC now that the BK would be discharged and released and were told that they would not be willing to work with us and that we should contact our attorney.	1
we ordered our home inspection. Post inspection	1
we paid XXXX with a trade in and were to pay an additional XXXX in cash. The dealer agreed to let us make payments on the XXXX until the balance was paid off. He also was able to get us approved by a bank in California for the remaining balance of XXXX. The transaction went well until we were in possession of the vehicle. We provided the dealer with a payment of XXXX dollars toward the XXXX owed	1
we paid all our property taxes	1
we paid down on our dream home. This is an XXXX and half bedroom condo in the heart of XXXX -- - ( no car needed ) XX/XX/XXXX	1
we paid our balance and signed up for Century Link at our new home ( I am sure they would NOT have given us new service without paying off the old ). I have no idea how to respond to these people. I DO NOT OWE THIS MONEY! These charges are erroneous or fraudulent but either way	1
we physically mailed in in the form. It has been three months since we submitted the form	1
we probably wo n't even get around to this short sale for the next month.	1
we proceeded with Deed In Lieu paperwork. As time went on	1
we reached a settlement agreement that I would pay {$100.00} per month. The money that was garnished was to be returned to me. The money that was garnished was never returned to me	1
we realized that every 30 days the modification was restarted by them. We must have submitted over XXXX modification packages. We contacted XXXX XXXX Counseling agency to see if with their assistance we can get better results. Nothing happened. We hired an attorney	1
we received a "" Notice of Pre-Foreclosure Options '' today in the mail	1
we received a letter addressed to my Estate from XXXX XXXX	1
we received a letter from CBNA acknowleding that they absolved me of the annual fee	1
we received a letter from XXXX XXXX firm dated XX/XX/XXXX with a reinstatement fee of {$20000.00} and not the total pay-off amount that we have been requesting. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and XXXX/XXXX/XXXX we received more phone calls from Ditech collections. We again told them we have been requesting a total pay-off for the mortgage. Collections verified that the letter dated XXXX/XXXX/XXXX should not have had the same good to date as the letter date. Collections also verified that the letter from XXXX did not give us the total pay-off amount as we requested but a reinstatement amount. After being on the phone for more than an hour and switched between departments we were transferred to XXXX in cc to get a total pay-off amount. It was confirmed that our multiple requests were on file. XXXX emailed us the total pay-off amount. We were shocked that it had grown from {$25.00} to {$33000.00}. We discussed payment methods with XXXX and verified wiring instructions. He told us taxes/insurance would be paid from escrow and paperwork would come in about 38 days. We did not go to case management since we finally had a figure and we wired {$33000.00} the following day XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. A week to 10 days later	1
we received a letter from the XXXX That noted "" Current Balance : Not Applicable ''. The letter also stated that the "" ... account is closed in our office ''. Not knowing what "" Current Balance : Not Applicable '' actually meant	1
we received a letter stating our payment was received and our next payment would be due on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Our XXXX XXXX	1
we received a short sale offer. We protested that we were requesting a loan modification. Many months passed and then the servicer requested all new financial information	1
we received an additional letter stating that a policy had been opened in our name anyway. After calling	1
we received an email from a shipping company asking {$850.00} for a crate to ship the dogs. We would get this money back at arrival of the dogs.	1
we received an offer to buy our house without contingency. It was below our balance due on our mortgage	1
we received another HUD-1 settlement statement in the mail that was changed on line XXXX. The payee was changed to "" XXXX '' instead of XXXX XXXX XXXX but the amount of {$60000.00} was not changed. We do n't have a mortgage with "" XXXX	1
we received calls from GreenTree stating that our payment had increased and we needed to pay an additional {$36.00} per month ; however	1
we received correspondence from XXXX - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( at the address of a relative where neither of us has ever resided ) requesting full payment of these loans. After learning of this correspondence	1
we received finalized paperwork for the modification and was told everything was good that it would take 2 weeks for system to update and that the new payment would start up the following month.. XXXX ( first week or so ) - System updated or so we were told. XXXX XXXX or XXXX - I called to let my case manager know I mailed in my XXXX payment 2 days prior of	1
we received no second or third notice of non-payment from XXXX	1
we received notice from XXXX that they had sold our mortgage to another company named SETERUS. All future calls to XXXX have not been returned. We have only had XXXX phone call with someone from SETERUS. First of all	1
we received notice that it had been returned. We contacted Ocwen inquiring as to the reason said payment had been returned. We were advised by a representative that they were unsure	1
we received notification from Wells Fargo that the entire balance for the months of the forbearance were due in full. We continued to make our monthly mortgage payment	1
we received our final bill from XXXX for {$51.00}	1
we received our regular email your XXXX statement is available for viewing log on to access ... nothing by email	1
we refaxed it. Something was still wrong. We had to start over	1
we rented it	1
we repeatedly called Bank of America for clarification	1
we reported the debit to U.S. Bank. On XX/XX/XXXX	1
we requested a deed in lieu of foreclosure in XX/XX/XXXX. Since then	1
we returned everything promptly. This is when our nightmare began. Ocwen claimed they hadn't received our documents	1
we sent an inquiry letter asking for status of our XX/XX/XXXX correspondence. Again	1
we sent another certified letter to SPS in regards to the loan being setup incorrectly. We requested a payoff statement and payment history on XXXX/XXXX/2015 from SPS. We received the payoff statement and again it reflects the incorrect information. The only responses we have received from SPS is that they are in receipt of correspondence. Nothing in writing to our complaint or request of documentation. We are requesting assistance before we file a lawsuit against SPS in regards to our loan being setup incorrectly.	1
we sent you the notice advising of the submission for the NMS review ( enclosed ). We have reviewed your inquiry	1
we should actually have {$3000.00} in a suspense account? We have been bounced around for XXXX months to different escalation specialists and there is still no resolution. We need help!	1
we should have received all of our Escrow Monies back from Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo did not return all of the escrow monies.	1
we simply want them to do what we believe is fair and will help both of us avoid a potential foreclosure situation.	1
we spoke daily	2
we started to fall behind on the payments in XXXX. At that time I contacted Chase to apply for assistance or to see if there is anything they can do to help me make my mortgage payments more affordable. At the time I was only about XXXX to XXXX payments behind so I asked them if they could add the past due payments to the end of my loan so I could start making my payments again and they said no	1
we started to make our usual monthly payments. However	1
we started to receive phone calls from a Hunter Warfield. We had no idea what that was and thought it was a solicitor. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX recieved an alert in the mail from Hunter Warfield	1
we stated we wanted the payments to be withdrawn from the business account	1
we still have money in the accounts that we can not access because they will be sending it to us in the form of cashier 's checks ... ... .Went to the local branch to try to resolve it ... ..System stated that they could not reopen account all the way up to branch manager ... ... A bad way to treat a potential customer ... ..I understand about the accounts being new but to close both accounts was a little ridiculous to me ... ... My wife was fuming about the whole situation because she deposited money into her account and there was no issues with it ... ... ..We have been basically banned from Bank of America for a minor mistake that was resolved in less than XXXX hours once it occurred ... ... ..	1
we still have not broken ground on the rebuild. Between Virginia Properties Insurance and Wells Fargo	1
we still have not received any communication from anyone who will help us resolve this issue.	1
we still owe more on the townhouse than it is worth. A HAFA short sale is our only option. The XXXX lender	1
we still receive multiple calls/day on multiple numbers ( home	1
we submit the evidence but the bank will wait until month end and send us a notice that they do n't have at least 30 days to review the evidence. The bank would then request the same evidence and we would submit it in a timely manner. This process went on for over 6-7 months. We have submitted and resubmitted the same evidence over 5 times and yet we did n't get a final approval. The bank assigned us relationship managers to facilitate this process but we have gone through XXXX relationship managers due to no fault of our own. What has really frustrated us has been the fact that as of XX/XX/XXXX the bank did n't accept payments from us. I thought that this meant the process was about to be finalized but then they started reporting our account as delinquent. My realtor and I have contacted the bank on numerous occasions but no one seems to know who is doing what. The bank 's reps transfer us to the assigned relationship XXXX who never answers the phone but after several calls would inform us that all they do is act as a go-between for the bank and us. The collections arm of the bank informs us that the delinquencies are automatically reported and they ca n't do anything about that. They further state that because we are in loss mitigation ( short sale ) we have to just wait until an approval is completed. Meanwhile the delinquencies are being reported on our credit bureau profiles which is negatively impacting us and could have ramifications for our security clearances. Nobody at US Bank Mortgage has been able to satisfactorily answer our questions or taken the time to look over our file and stop any unjustified negative reports. As a military family this is placing such a weight on us. We have done everything in power to collaborate with the bank and afford them some leeway but the negative impact this process is having on us is unwarranted. We did not chose to relocate to VA but obeyed military orders and having to pay almost $ XXXX/month in rent while paying $ XXXX/month in mortgage payments is a burden we ca n't sustain. I am a XXXX XXXX veteran and currently do n't work so the financial responsibility is exorbitant. US Bank could have approved this short sale as of XX/XX/XXXX or even XX/XX/XXXX but they continude to delay the process and now we are getting significantly impacted negatively. I have made several attempts to contact US Bank outside of routine calls but have received nothing but inconclusive responses. Nearly all US Bank reps I 've talked to have expressed their lack of understanding for why getting a final decision is took so long. I thought that once we received the letter stating the minimum amount the bank was willing to accept for the sale of our home	1
we submitted the offer and since XXXX XXXX we have not received any communication back from the lender. Chase is ignoring all my Realtors email requests	1
we suppose they will say the same again in total disregard of the law. We do not know what Wells Fargo wants	1
we switched the account to her name	1
we then got no statement in the mail	1
we thought	1
we thought. Any how the man was a close childhood friend. We went to a finace company to get a l loan on his truck	1
we told her that we never received a parking ticket or a ticket was ever placed in the windshield of our car	1
we tried everything. Our lender -PNC Mortgage- suggested that we do a "" deed in lieu of foreclosure "" which we completed in XXXX of 2015.	1
we tried following up with how things are going. We did n't hear from there for a whole week after many tries. At the two week window before close of escrow and receiving paperwork to remove contingencies	1
we use our own methods of disputes ''. Note : How is it that the XXXX investigated results received from the same reporting debt collection agency handling all the same accounts in question	1
we want Green Tree to refund that money via check XXXX {$500.00} XXXX since they said they did n't assess it anyway as follows : '' ... there has not been a late fee assessed to your account	1
we was in the swimming pool when about XXXX XXXX was skipping rocks across the pool. It was me	1
we went down to the bank and they promised that within a week we should receive our bonus	1
we went through a non-contested divorce	1
we went through the numbers and there is some mysterious amount of over {$7000.00} that is listed as an "" actual '' payment that does not match up in any way with the document I received from the township. The statement The Money Source sent is very confusing and has "" actual '' payments and disbursements listed. What 's the difference? Either they are guilty of gross negligence in calculating my property taxes not once	1
we were NOT up to date	1
we were able to borrow some money from a family member and made the 2 month payments. Once we made this payment	1
we were asking less than the amount we owed US Bank on our mortgage. In XXXX we filed the short sale paperwork with our mortgage bank and alerted our realtor we were in short sale territory. By late XXXX or XXXX	1
we were held liable for the loss. They said I am liable because I authorized these transactions. I asked how you can show I authorized the transactions such as which device they were initiated from but they could n't provide me with an answer. So I was accused of stealing money from my own account and they ca n't provide me any proof. Thus they used this to deny to reimburse me back. I request an appeal but they said the case was already reviewed twice and they refused to look into again. Therefore I am bringing this to legal actions. I feel this is the only resort left to get my money back.	1
we were in loss mitigation and apparently	1
we were informed Ocwen had still not received the bill	1
we were informed that "" pending '' charges could n't be disputed or stopped because they had not been honored yet and we were forced to wait three weeks and face late fees from our mortgage institution and utilities because we had to wait a long period of time to have the charges investigated because of their "" pending '' status. Additionally	1
we were informed that our loan was conventional. We submitted several qualified written statements to XXXX XXXX	1
we were just charged a lump sum of over {$8800.00}. on our XXXX accounts for two years ' interest on the entire balance ( previously about {$11000.00} ).	1
we were never informed verbally that a lien would be placed on the home by HUD. This has create a hardship for us because no one will touch our home due to this XXXX lien. We are falling farther behind on our mortgage and other bills we want to save our home	1
we were not going to simply hand them over money for something	1
we were not. However	1
we were notified that the closing would be delayed for an unknown time period while NVR Mortgage awaited receiving tax forms that we signed off to be ordered on XXXX XXXX. While we waited for the tax forms	1
we were only able to rent our home for approx $ XXXX LESS than what our mortgage payment was. We maintained this monthly financial burden for 20 months. Not to mention the obligation on our end to maintain a property 2.5 hours from our new home.	1
we were placed on hold. When she came back	1
we were provided with the following case / claim number : XXXX. We have no confidence that this matter will be resolved in a timely and correct manner. I look forward to your assistance in resolving this matter.	1
we were required to pay PMI.Based on discussions with the lender & our loan agreements was the PMI would be automatically removed when at 78 %	1
we were specifically told by the "" Responsible lending Team that the Pre-set spending limit would be removed after the income level increases. In turn	1
we were still at square one..only now we owed the bank interest and penalties. As a last resort we attended a meeting in our state capitol with an agency to help people like us make some headway with our lenders.After four or five hours	1
we were strung along by XXXX until they sold the mortgage to Residential Credit Solutions (RCS) who then told us that they were working with us on the loan modification.  In reality	1
we were taken back on the amount. It was extremely high! Even with late fees	1
we were then almost a XXXX. behind on our mortgage. once you get that far behind there is no catching up. we hired a lawyer he did absolutely nothing but lie to us and take our money. what is this world coming too? then another lawyer and they are like well just file chapter XXXX and your new payment is XXXX a month. you got to be kidding me. we couldnt afford XXXX a month but now XXXX. give me a break. we had our house appraised it come in at XXXX we owe XXXX which is exactly what we barrowed XXXX yrs. ago. i will  not give up until they physically throw us out. why cant anyone stop this co. from their illegal	1
we were then notified by Wells Fargo that our HAMP application was rejected because "" you withdrew your request ''. This is not true. We rejected the refinancing option. NOT the HAMP application.	1
we were told by Citibank that the information we received regarding the repayment of the forbearance amount was incorrect. Citibank stated that this was the result of inaccurate and misinformation being administered by customer service because of the unique situation regarding XXXX XXXX. Citibank further stated that in their effort to administer aid to XXXX victims as quickly as possible customer service was not fully knowledgeable of what procedures regarding forbearances were permitted.	1
we were told for market validation	1
we were told that our house appraised at only {$200000.00} by an appraisal company from Indiana and we could only get a new mortgage if we paid {$10000.00} for it up front. The appraisal was based on more than XXXX houses	1
we were told that the XXXX forgiveness act was expiring and we should file for bankruptcy against the house due to it still being in our name and again in active foreclosure. The home was discharged in XXXX XXXX. Our loan had been sold to XXXX when XXXX went under	1
we were told the contractor would be in touch to schedule the work that week. We never heard from him and called him numerous times. ( XXXX of Sears selling points	1
we were told they had closed the account due to non usage in XXXX XXXX. When asked why they had not notified us they said that "" we e-mailed you ''. When we asked them to "" re-open '' the account they indicated that they could n't and we 'd need to reapply.	1
we were unable to move forward with the VA loan and decided to switch to a conventional loan. I was told repeatedly that this would not be an issue based on our good credit ( an excellent score of XXXX ) and income ; and even received a good faith estimate that we would need approximately $ 3k to close the loan. Suddenly	1
we were unable to refinance with any other company because we owed far more on the loan than we originally borrowed. We have tried for 5 years to have Wells Fargo correct the errors in our loan servicing	1
we were very close to the loan 's maturity date. Unfortunately that appraisal revealed that our house was worth {$15000.00} less than we owned. The mortgage company pulled out. Working through HUD	1
we will be informing our clients that we will not be able file their cases until I am able to secure a different credit card with a high limit or get the appeal settled with Amex. We will also see our credit score drop dramatically because the reduction in the line will cause our loan-to-available-credit ratio dramatically increase. I believe this act should be considered Unfair	1
we will be withdrawing our money and direct deposits from your bank and closing our account as you clearly are not a customer friendly bank. Get it together as the CEO of this company XXXX.	1
we will bring the mortgage up to date. Please advise on how we can stop Ditech from conducting this unfair practice and the acceleration.	1
we will continue to report and remain on your credit report for seven year. Even after XXXX informed me and I informed them that XXXX stated that they should not be listed on mt credit report.	1
we will make a note of this and it will be fixed. With the exception of today	1
we will not process a duplicative dispute. If you have new or different information that is relevant to your dispute	1
we will now have to pay over {$4000.00} over the life of the loan without this resolution.	1
we will take further action ''	1
we will update and remove you from XXXX. '' I have over a dozen calls logged to US Bank along with some letters. In addition	1
we willrepost the payments etc ...	1
we would be taken off from the account as primaries. Considering the circumstances	1
we would direct her back to the mortgage banker and advised that the documents had already been supplied. As a consumer we should not have to be accountable for the lack of internal communication at Wells Fargo. Instead there should be a process set up whereby the processor reaches out to the mortgage banker to obtain the documents before going to the consumer. XX/XX/XXXX the appraisal process began. The initial appraisal was provided on XXXX/XXXX/15 and was valued well under the purchase price of our home. During the following week there was a lot of back and forth with the bank about the issue. In the end a Mortgage Manager ( XXXX XXXX ) contacted us to advise our options. In order to keep our settlement date of XXXX/XXXX/15	1
we would have abandoned this endeavor after the second failed attempt.	1
we would have to get a POD for {$1000.00}. We reluctantly changed the closing to a dual closing on XXXX XXXX. We received the final disclosure on XXXX/XXXX/15 and I found errors. There was no {$500.00} for failure to close on time as promised by BofA	1
we would have to submit it writing. We faxed our written complaint/timeline and request for the fee to be waived and received a resolution letter stating that the fee would be waived just this "" once ''. It was a "" form letter '' and did not address the concern that we were not notified of escrow changes which would affect or payments. The XX/XX/XXXX statement came with the late fee on it	1
we would pay the penalty and there was nothing they could do. Unacceptable	1
we would reluctantly obtain the additional insurance. Each year I would google the topic and hope to find something about the practice and the fact it is suspect. Last year I was thrilled to find that a Lawsuit was filed again them for this exact issue. I researched and then inquired about joining the class action lawsuit. We joined the lawsuit and were given a claim number and submitted the paperwork by the deadline and waited. The next thing I know	1
we would tell collections we are doing a short sale they would not know because one department area does not know what the other area has on file.. Personnel changes did not help the situation. In these XXXX months I have had XXXX different persons working with my account	1
we wrote appeal letter dated around XXXX XXXX asking for further review. I did made a few calls to XXXX the status but up to date	1
wedding certificate and death certificate. Seterus keeps telling me to go trhough probate. I 've been informed that under the federal code regulations and XXXX 's guidelines	1

well now I find that none of our finances were being taken care of and I see where I am in default in all my loans. I do not want to lose my home and would like the opportunity to fix this issue.	1
wells fargo only is delaying my process by asking me for documents every time i call. I called in on late XXXX 2015 and was told to submit my package as soon as possible	1
wells paid pty taxes on XXXX XXXX and town should issue a refund to wells	1
went back to the bank the associate said she wouldhave the transfer returned and sent another bank transfer	1
went back to work and have not missed a payment but this is impacting my credit score ( along with medical bills that were to be paid by the fault of the other insurance ) & I can not get a loan anywhere at a decent rate.	1
went bankrupt and sold our loan to Green Tree. Prior to the sell	1
went out of business and shuttered its doors in XXXX. Yet	1
went outside and my car was gone. Now prior to this	1
went to non-profit organizations to assist homeowners	1
went with me into the vault to empty the box and I gave her the key when I was done. She gave me a receipt. I moved XXXX the next month and continued my other accts. with Wells Fargo. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I received a call from Wells Fargo saying that I owed for another year 's rent on the safety deposit box. I told them I closed it and gave them the receipt number. The man I spoke to said "" all was taken care of and not to worry ''. A year later I was moved back XXXX - still having a Wells Fargo account - and when I went into a local branch to change personal information I was told that I now owed for two years safety deposit box fees ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) - I told him that box was emptied and closed and he said I would have to take care of that at the original branch. So I drove over 30 miles to the XXXX location and explained the situation with them. I no longer had the receipt. They said there was nothing I could do. They continue to hold the box in my name and charge me yearly fees for an empty box that I closed. The only document I have is the business card of the woman who closed the account for me. I do not wish to collect monetary damages for my out-of-pocket expenses/duress in dealing with this. I just want them to close the safety deposit box account and remove any debt associated with that from my name. They are a rich bank who made a mistake and lost the key and they are trying to make me - who lives on limited income - pay for their mistake. Please assist me with this problem. I did not know where to turn until I saw your name in a news article.	1
were both able to show that the funds were wired to Wells Fargo XXXX.	1
were dismissed in their bankruptcy. I no longer have XXXX loans on my credit because of this. Unknowingly	1
were fraudulent and without my permission and/or consent. American EXPRESS must know that such conducts by it`s employees were in clear violation of my Privacy Right and FCRA.This has continued to adversely affect me obtaining credit ; housing and meaningful employment.	1
were letters to stall me and discourage me from pursuing anymore evidence or verification. At least XXXX times on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX they responded to my concerns with letters claiming that I was being "" suspicious '' and potentially "" fraudulent '' and that they refused to process any more of my disputes. I am so confused by how a credit reporting company	1
were mishandled and processed as Short Sales ... NEVER was any paperwork completed for a short sale during that time frame. I filed a complaint with Chase 's corporate office and they looked into the matter. They returned a denial for assistance very quickly. So the house was then put up for Short Sale in the end of XXXX. XXXX offer came in and by late XXXX was withdrawn due to the buyer failing to meet certain requirements. I again filed a modification package	1

were unable and unwilling to assist me.	1
were usually not helpful. I once again faced a large problem when I was told that the routing number on my checking acct was being changed and received a letter stating such. I went in to a branch to get assistance. They looked over my account	1
what	1
what 's the check number	1
what I gathered from a group of questions was that if you were unemployed	1
what I owed on it ( $ XXXX ) and what units had sold for recently in my development ( at the time pending $ XXXX ) .I asked him to use a value of $ XXXX for my home	1
what account I owed money for and that they need to send me papers to see along with advertised lawsuit that was "" filed '' by the collection agency. They just hanged up on me. I called back and that same person again used profanity against me	1
what are "" MISC. POSTINGS ''?	1
what did the {$390.00} go to? Please help!!	1
what fraud had occurred exactly? Only after becoming irate	1
what had been an automatic withdrawal for the normal mortgage payment	1
what had happened was I fell behind on my credit cards. I 've made arrangements on every single one	1
what happened is someone DID use my information but it was well after I moved from the address they originally have that they say I used to apply. I am sick of this XXXX and it has been years and still get no where or it removed from my credit report	1
what i have is what i use to support me and my family	1
what is happening to me	1
what it contained	1
what their rights even are	1
what they will again doing with the rest of {$1800.00} left. I told them that I am struggling with my other bills when money sitting on a account which I do not have no control over. I am really living on a budget because I only survive on my SSI money and a part time Job. I told them in that case I will pay my taxes but no answer from them. 2 ) Also my principal is {$85000.00} and my rate is XXXX and my monthly mortgage is {$900.00} a month. with that rate	1
whatever that is. I asked to speak to a Manager	1
when Bank of the West closed the account and referred it to a collections agency.	1
when I am not. Apparently they misapplied a payment initially which makes them think I am late. I have assured them that I have not missed a single payment. They are telling me that I now have to pay a private company {$290.00} plus a monthly fee to make my payments like this. Are you kidding me?? When I spoke with them in XXXX	1
when I asked XXXX of bank America why	1
when I asked for the reason why	1
when I asked for the {$20.00} I would have had in my account back they said that I could file a fraud claim to get the money back. I then reminded them that I did state I made the charge and I would not be filing as that would have been fraudulent. The manager said that would be the only way to get the money back	1
when I asked the collection agent to validate the debt	1
when I asked to set arrangements. The convergent collector was rude	1
when I called I got someone in another country and had to insist that I be transferred to someone in America as the person was "" not fluent in XXXX '' and extremely hard to understand. I did not "" sign-up '' for a monthly monitoring service	1
when I called XXXX	1
when I called and they were unhelpful and clueless when I told them I mailed it in and transferred me to different people in customer service to keep telling my story over & over again. I got no advise so I said I would pay it online to have proof of my payment. The next day	1
when I called for a status Friday XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
when I called she demanded payment of the debt and an apology even though she said she knows it 's not me they want	1
when I called the M & T CSR phone number my call was redirected back to XXXX XXXX XXXX. I explained everything to XXXX XXXX a service rep at XXXX. He responded that this was correct	1
when I called to complain the XXXX time I was told I would need to produce proof that I paid interest on this item to have the full refund to my account.	1
when I could n't find out who held my title	1
when I could n't find out who held my title deed and mortgage lien.In XXXX	1
when I discovered the error on my credit report. The bank on which the check was drawn NEVER RECEIVED the check and thus could not have returned it. I have that letter in writing from that bank proving it was never received	1
when I disputed their response they ignored that dispute and the complaint is now closed. I need them to correct their mistakes as stated before and show that the mortgage is up to date. We have been paying as agreed since the mortgage was modified in XXXX 2014.	1
when I do n't answer one number or block it they start calling from another. They have been extremely obnoxious and have even contacted friends and members of my family after being requested not to.	1
when I finally did have money in my account. That day	1
when I get my taxes just paid it off. ( But I have n't receive taxes yet ) SO I took the additional {$500.00}	1
when I go into the account	1
when I got to work at XXXX I went online and checked my balance and transactions. It still said I had a balance of {$380.00}. At this point I realized I still had XXXX checks outstanding and I needed to transfer money from my savings. I transferred {$1200.00}. That would cover the {$1500.00} in outstanding checks. XXXX hours later I received and email saying my account was over withdrawn. Again	1
when I had a balance which I have never done. I spoke to a supervisor named XXXX ( employee # XXXX ) only to be informed that he could do nothing	1
when I have Disputed the claim	1
when I have told them not to contact me	1
when I indicated that no classes were taken nor permission to initiate what the representatives called a "" loan '' the statement was ignored. I stated this XXXX times. In addition	1
when I know that what she is saying is not true or legal to say.	1
when I logged on to their internet site	1
when I lost my job. I was current on my mortgage and remarried in XXXX. I moved to my husband 's home and we continued to pay XXXX mortgages	1
when I made another multiple month payment in XXXX of last year	1
when I make additional principal pre-payments	1
when I now live over XXXX miles away. So I begged and borrowed and came up with {$1000.00} and settled the debt with XXXX XXXX Bank. Then to my surprise I begin getting multiple letters from other collectors collecting on this same account. I send them my settlement letters and they ca n't understand why I paid XXXX when my total debt is only XXXX. I finally get in contact with Cohen and Associates	1
when I pull the payment history it says 30 days past due XX/XX/2015 which is incorrect. Any help getting my credit score fixed from this would be a great help.	1
when I questioned PNC	1
when I realized my calculation error	1
when I receive a letter from them stating that I owe them {$320.00} or they will turn me over to a collection agency. I called Nationwide in regards to the matter and they claim that they were paying my mortgage	1
when I receive a statement	1
when I received my next statement	1
when I returned home from the store the home improvement project loan card had arrived via fedex to my home. The following day I had to provide copies of my tax returns to the loan customer service department	1
when I sent a message to inquire about the status of the {$400.00} on XXXX XXXX	1
when I sent an email to the company it came back non deliverable. XXXX XXXX claims they hold the note but can not figure out how to reach them as when I call the company my s.s. does not come up. I have also tried to get a loan modification and they have said I did not send in the paperwork when I did and XXXX went to the bankruptcy court to dismiss my case when they have no proof of holding and certificate or note to foreclose without offering me any assistance to catch up. We had to make them an offer but I never signed any paperwork nor did the bankruptcy judge.	1
when I signed up for a new cable service ( to allow me to save {$120.00} a month! )	1
when I still had not received my correct XXXX statement	1
when I told her how I initially attempted to apply for forbearance in good faith in XXXX	1
when I tried to login	1
when I was able to pay them off and my credit was better my reward was to be cancelled. I think BOA has a history of this action for a lot of consumers and it is fundamentally unfair. Would be interesting to know how many times they have cancelled a consumer 's credit card at the point it was paid to zero	1
when I was about to make the XXXX payment I realized that the funds were not applied	1
when I was available b/c they called always during my working hours	1
when I was contacted by the collection agency I was threatened. Not knowing any better	1
when I was finally issued a tracking number. I went to XXXX XXXX and was told the number was invalid. I called AmEx again and they confirmed the number was correct and that I should try again in 48 hours. Again	1
when I was not even in US!! Someone can contact XXXX to verify that information. Not being able to rent a house is the most difficult thing. Where am I supposed to live!	1
when I was previously paying 300 dollars. The XXXX creditors do not report this account correctly.	2
when I was previously paying XXXX dollars. The XXXX creditors do not report this account correctly.	1
when I watched TV commercials I would see ( and still see ) that lease offers were much more below than what I was really paying ( up to {$150.00} less ). On my latest experience purchasing a Civic at XXXX XXXX in XXXX	1
when I went into the branch on XXXX XXXX	1
when I went online and realized they had n't received my fax from my neighbors house on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX	1
when I went to apply for a loan and my credit rating was XXXX points lower than it should have been. I made the account current. I called to have then correct the credit report and they refused to do anything. Citizens the holder of the note said that Firstmark Services was responsible for the credit reporting and Firstmark said that XXXX was in charge of credit reporting. I told XXXX that I had a complaint and they offered no help. I told Firstmark that I wanted to talk to someone about my complaint and XXXX # XXXX said that there was nothing they could do about the credit reporting. Finally after a very long conversation XXXX said she could send me a complaint form. XXXX said her system said that they mailed notices to me	1
when Select Portfolio alleges that I missed a payment	1
when a different amount was attempted to be collected I was told that it did not matter what that person agreed to. In New York State a verbal agreement is tantamount to a contract and as such is where they provided service. They have harassed me for the last 7 years to collect something that is not owed to them.	1
when a judge sees what BOA has put me through. Of course I wish the CFPB would actually do their job but that seems like a stretch at this point.	1
when actually they have not. Emails and phone calls have not been replied to and the entire process has been detrimental to the consumer. I have lost time at my job fold conference calls	1
when all of a sudden	1
when all the carpet needed was cleaning. The collections agency is constantly flagging my credit report every month.	1
when and to whom the loans are for because there maybe an error. Secondly I would like to consolidate or at least get lower rates	1
when another branch of the bank seized the XXXX and took it over in XX/XX/XXXX. I was at the bank a month ago and inquired about getting my property back ... The clerk advised that the property was still in my name.	1
when asked to confirm ownership of account with XXXX the refuse to do so. XXXX is also refusing to contact CBE Group. XXXX states that a SSN was not provided to CBE	1
when asked to get a Satisfaction filed	1
when buying from family they can not have any late payments over the last 12 months or it is considered a bail out situation. This is the first I had heard or was told of this guideline. This was never mentioned or asked by the mortgage person. The day of closing	1
when compared with the other credit bureaus	1
when he came back with the booklet ( Deposit Account Agreement )	1
when he did I advise that they had the incorrect routing number. He apologized and got it correct for me	1
when he did go back to work	1
when his information was requested	1
when i called them i was told by XXXX to file a complain to you.i want that to be clear from my credit report.	1
when in actuality this was not the case since we were then sent to quality control and no longer allowed to close. We were also mislead be XXXX XXXX personally as I was specifically told nothing was wrong with our loan being sent to quality control	1
when in fact I do	1
when in fact they are not the party at all responding. I have conversed with XXXX XXXX XXXX time today at XXXX and I have conversed with XXXX XXXX on XXXX separate calls today at XXXX. While there is no harm committed with regard to their response in that I should contact XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX	1
when in reality we just wanted to make sure the papers were correct. Now we are being told we can agree again but owe the months leading up to this when they failed to do their job in a lump sum.	1
when it 's time to pay XXXX bill it will be short and I 'll have to send more money that will get held and have fees taken out of. So	1
when it came time to send the money and ship Idid this ( for XXXX ) for XXXX laptops to ship. My salesman got back to meand said paypal put a 21 day hold on the money. He coerced me into sending via XXXX option instead	1
when it came to collecting the documentation to substantiate my qualification for the loan	1
when it never should have been made in the first place. So because Transunion and XXXX would rather play nice with the XXXX rather than do the right thing	1
when it should only have been {$25000.00}.	1
when it was due	1
when it was paid off. Then	1
when it was sold.	1
when my employee refused his offer he said there was no message. XXXX called back a few hours later	1
when my unemployment benefits are made available to my account.	1
when my unemployment payments were about to end. After 3 months of numerous requests for additional documentation	1
when other bank 's ATM machine broken and none other available for several miles	1
when other mortgage companies knew in a few hours if I would qualify for a loan or not. I was passed between XXXX different people/departments during this ridiculous process	1
when our loan was transferred from XXXX to Green tree they bluntly stated that they would not honor this modification that we had paid on for more than a year and that they were raising our payment nearly {$600.00} a month. Since that time we have been fighting to get answers and save our home but have made no progress. Green tree has not reviewed us for options to resolve this issue ; they have not assigned a contact to work on our case and have never given us any explanation as to how and why this has happened. I want to file a formal complaint against Green Tree.	1
when our new mortgage company	1
when pressed for more information	1
when previously all note payments were made at the local offices. My most recently interactions were with BB & T associate XXXX XXXX of the XXXX office. XXXX XXXX also informed me after I sent a note payment to the address on the invoice from BB & T that the new requirement was to send all payments directly to her	1
when she was not able to adequately explain my concerns	1
when speaking with financial aid	1
when spefically asked if with government XXXX	1
when that did n't work they tried to freeze my bank account	1
when that happened i was charged late fees	1
when the Assignment of Mortgage was recorded and filed in the office of the City Register of the XXXX.	1
when the BOA collection department started sending me letter and had me pay them {$540.00}. I understand that I am responsible for the {$44.00} as it is the service fee for the last six months	1
when the bill arrived it included the {$150.00} early termination fee. I again called XXXX XXXX and this time the customer service rep was very short with me	1
when the check I deposited is still on hold. They never put that money into my account They are literally stealing my money to cover a check that they never cashed for me. I spoke to someone in the corporate office in XXXX and they do n't know why the branch manager is holding the check. This is unusual because a week or so before I deposited a check from the gentleman the rents a room in my home. It was his S.S. check. He signed it and I put it in my account. There was no problem with that check. I need for this matter to be looked into because my XXXX check is direct deposit. How is it that they can go into my account an manipulate it the way they want. What does my money have to do with a check on hold in the account.	1
when the e-payment finally posted	1
when the full amount+ is always sent in WAY before the due date. Then I have to spend too much time on the phone getting fees reversed and explaining to them how to apply the payment correctly. If it didn ; t cost me money	1
when the technical attempted to install the service	1
when the window to confirm my choice was displayed	1
when there are other types that do not require a monthly fee. I will most likely have to close the account now which makes me mad as it 's linked to family members for transferring money. I would like a differrent account that does not charge a monthly fee. Additionally	1
when they bank executed us the marshal who "" served '' us was permitted to keep XXXX of the amount executed for services rendered so in actuality	1
when they debt incurred	1
when they did they only gave me a part of my escrow credit. Third	1
when they do not I have to start the process all over again with another supposed 48 hours. I recently talked to a XXXX ( supervisor ) on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and she assured me it would be taken care of and she would call me back to confirm. Now it is XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and still nothing	1
when they finally approved both refis	1
when they reentered it onto my credit report on XXXX XXXX	1
when they saw the police they tried to speed away but the police stopped them and made them leave	1
when they sold the loan to Rushmore Loan Management	1
when they transferred my first mortgage to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. They refused to refinance my mortgage not for lack of documentation. But	1
when we called on Monday the XXXX of XXXX	1
when we fell on hard times. We were granted a Forbearance from XXXX XXXX through XXXX XXXX	1
when we logged into XXXX	1
when we made a written request to cancel the PMI	1
when we questioned what the parameters were and who got reductions or arrears due at maturity we were told they could n't explain that there is no guideline for that it is up to the lender and select portfolio case by case in this case we are clearly being discriminated against in almost a XXXX kind of way because our last name is XXXX. They pick & choose who gets a principal reduction or the arrears to be foregiven or put on the back end of a loan if they a want to they can. we qualify and have asked for just arrears to be on back end. XXXX salaried employees combined make XXXX now as she just got a XXXX per month raise. We have no bills but piti	1
when we speak to Bank of America	1
when we went into the local wells fargo bank	1
when we would have another paycheck. They continued to call 3-4 times a day and also at my place of employment. I questioned this and told them that I had previously requsted that no calls be made to me at my place of employment. They indicated that the account was noted and they had called in error. In the past 3 weeks I have received over XXXX calls from Greentree at my place of employment by the same individual that indicated that my account was noted for no more calls. I had even gone so far as requesting that the phone number be removed from their system	1
when you need Good housing for my son who is XXXX. And they do not care who much money they take and rob you of. Enclosed in my complaint is the XX/XX/XXXX. My lease is up XX/XX/XXXX	1
when?	1
where I can find banks that do those types of loans?	1
where I initially leased back in XXXX. That situation has been RESCINDED and cleared from XXXX County public records. And should not have been filed in the first place since the situation was taken care of and paid in full prior to filing the Summary Motion from XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX will be addressed accordingly. On-site rental reporting company has created damages to my reputation and integrity to have their damaging and inaccurate report. sent to prospective landowners/leasing agents. I have been in the mortgage lending industry since XX/XX/XXXX	1
where I marked the box stating : "" I WANT TO BE REVIEWED FOR ALL MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE OPTIONS. '' However	1
where I was immediately directed to collections	1
where I would fall behind. When I did fall behind	1
where a voicemail was left for XXXX XXXX the processor after a letter stating that an updated XXXX form was needed. This was faxed to US Bank the same day. On XXXX/XXXX/2015 XXXX called in and advised of a new LIST of documents needed now. Stating that they need updated retirement award letter and a XXXX for co borrower - advised XXXX was received	1

where it is evident that employees of Capital One Bank made unauthorized inquiry into my credit report.	1
where my wife and I have all of our accounts. My son requested a credit card	1
where prior to XXXX XXXX XXXX my identifying information to add that incorrect entry to the report	1
where the account was opened	1
where the mortgage was already paid upon the receipt of the alleged borrower 's signature. Evidence of this fraud is attached copies of the Promissory Note. Notice how Copy A ( which the Defendant first signed ) lacks the signature of a bank representative. However	1
where the worker hung up on me after receiving my case number. Now there 's nothing I can do about this fraudulent charge that was a mistake on the part of Transunion and XXXX XXXX XXXX without hiring an attorney over a {$130.00} charge from XXXX years ago.	1
where they said that communication regarding no XXXX transaction fees was in error. I have a trip to XXXX planned for XXXX	1
where they would endorse it and I could then pay them off. I made an appointment with the Assistant branch manager XXXX XXXX on XXXX XXXX	1
where we patiently waited XXXX XXXX hours for a Claims manager due to the 'high volume ' of calls	1
where your organization has made inquiries into my credit history	1
whereas	1
wherefore after my debit card was swiped for {$770.00} my Lowe 's card was subsequently declined. Much to my surprise	1
whereupon I closed the account. This was a clear misrepresentation of the card 's terms by both airline personnel and the card issuer. There was also no stated minimum purchase requirement in the materials that came with the card. Please alert others to this deceptive business practice.	1
whether it be additional principal payments or monthly mortgage payments. It takes quite a number of phone calls	1
whether my identity was stolen	1
which	3
which CLEARLY show I was disputing the late payments reported	1
which Citibank had done to XXXX. The week following the credit limit increase	1
which DOES have that security	1
which Experian requested via thier phone message that they have for the consumer when the consumer calls to order thier credit report	1
which I 'm doing	1
which I 'm told I must be at least 2 months late to qualify	1
which I accepted because we have merchant account services with Bank of America. Before to process the credit card I called at Bank of America several times	1
which I agreed to do. Months later	1
which I am authorized to manage	1
which I am not. Apparently they are looking for the file	1
which I am not. They have provided me no proof of their assertions	1
which I am paying approximately {$1100.00} per month. I 've been trying for over a year to gain a modification from Citibank	1
which I am still paying interest on today.	1
which I answered. And then a few weeks later	1
which I assumed were from those two attempts. I called Capital One on XX/XX/XXXX. I explained that I had not authorized the charges	1
which I attempted to make at least a half dozen times only to be stonewalled by complicated phone menus and hold times in excess of twenty minutes. This is definitely an attempt to break the spirit of the federal collection dispute laws. This is unreasonable of them ; XXXX allow on-line or faxed disputes.	1
which I ca n't based on my credit rating. I am asking the CFPB to help me work with XXXX to keep my home. I also need them to stop threatening me since I am maiking weekly payments. Also if they can reduce or waive these lat charge. I can be reached at XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
which I certainly did not. I have refused this card for years	1
which I corrected within a hour. I was told they have the right to do this because the amount was pending even thought it never went through. How can a bank charge for overdrafts when money is never taken from your account.	1
which I could not afford.	1
which I did	4
which I did ; and was approved. However	1
which I did and I still have no resolution to the issue. They now tell me it will be another 30 days which would be 7 months since they claim I missed a payment. Some reps at Seterus say they are reporting negatively to the credit agencies and others have said they are not. The rep I spoke to last advised she could n't even confirm if the XXXX bank statement I faxed had been received. So I guess I have to assume that it has. Each time I call I get different information. The handling of this situation seems too unethical and unfair to me as their customer. I 've made my payment each month. I 've given them the proof they need to show that and they still have not resolved the issue. It is also ridiculous to me that a regulated financial company would not realize they were missing a payment until 5 months later-which in reality I paid. The service I 've received has been horrible and the different information on every call does not lead me to believe they will ever solve this issue and I will have no other recourse	1
which I did by regular mail and later by certified mail. So far I have not received any response from them	1
which I did in 36 months.	1
which I did n't even notice. after about 90 days their collection folks contacted me. I told them they were mistaken-as we had an arrangement. I was then told that they had inexplicably stopped taking payments-and needed me to reauthorize them. I agreed to contact my bank and begin SENDING monthly payments-rather than giving the the opportunity to drop the ball yet again. I did	1
which I did not authorize them to do. In less than XXXX months they have made insurance payments to cancelled services	1
which I did not feel comfortable doing	1
which I did not have on me. On XX/XX/2016	1
which I did not sign up for. I have been trying for several months to get it taken off but they say they can not remove it without a cancellation letter yet NO ONE can find an additional policy under my or my husbands name - hence	1
which I did not. I have the proof that I owed nothing more to this company and can provide this. I then began receiving collection notifications from Pacific Credit Services that increased each month. I never received any notification from the daycare - no warning	1
which I did on XXXX. I gave them all the information for the transaction	1
which I did that has been going on for two years. So it started at XXXX and now is XXXX and they having me owing {$300000.00} in fees and paments and XXXX in escrow arrears. They wo n't send me copies of the fees I owe or the original note or XXXX. Statements or Countywide documents or anything I request actually. I am a XXXX widow and have my late husbands daughter who is XXXX. This is the only home she 's known and I got completely messed over with my original loan. I feel like I 'm being walked over and I ca n't get any answers or help.	1
which I did. Afterward	1
which I did. Again I began receiving the packages from Wells Fargo wanting the documents via XXXX and continually being called for payment. I also during all this time received letters with the name & number of a NEW acct. specialist for my mortgage. By around XXXX I had no response and again called XXXX. My rep was busy so I spoke to "" XXXX '' who said I should type an email via the website asking for some feedback from Wells Fargo and when I asked him about the packages I was receiving he laughed and told me NOT to send them back because that would nullify my file with XXXX & I would then have to go through the bank for a modification which was more lucrative to the bank & the reason they were sending them. I emailed the bank via the site asking for them to work with me & help me to save my home - no response for several weeks. In the meantime I am falling further and further behind on the mortgage. I again received a letter from the bank several weeks ago that due to them no receiving the documents requested they were closing my acct. I was also very angry with the XXXX rep because I felt I gotten little help from her ( did n't respond when I left voicemails or sent emails ). When I called the bank about a week ago I spoke to XXXX XXXX and went over the whole story you see here. He told me he was looking at my file as we spoke and seemed perplexed as to why nothing was done with my file	1
which I did. BoA reps were very rude this time	1
which I did. During the dispute process I discovered not only had they refused to recognize this was an error	1
which I did. I also sent Solomon and Solomon a copy of my "" Appearance '' form. They then asked the court for a "" Motion For Default - Failure To Plead ''. The court responded thus : "" The foregoing	1
which I did. In XX/XX/XXXX the mortgage company sent me XXXX. Later	1
which I did. In XXXX of XXXX my payment was rejected and foreclosure proceedings were initiated. I continued to contact Flagstar to try and remedy the account. I was now dealing with Flagstar and XXXX	1
which I did. This time	1
which I do n't give when people call me! I was told that these matters wo n't be investigated because the gentleman & his supervisor stated they needed my XXXX #	1
which I do not even know how they obtained his number seeing how I did n't even know that he existed at the time they claim the date was. They stated that they use a "" very powerful search engine ''. If so then how come no bill was sent to my correct address or how come they did not call MY number? I was APALLED at how I was spoken to. I then proceeded to try and get as much information as possible	1
which I do not. If you look at my credit history	1
which I feel is harassment. Sometimes they call XXXX after another	1
which I find very offensive and do n't know how to fix. Another reason I have been given is that they could not find my son 's name on the check stubs faxed in. Which again I do n't understand because the previous person said they see the name. Every time I call which is once per week	1
which I had been paying my payments on every month until then.	1
which I have to log in to the website to see	1
which I have tried to resolve with my servicer	1
which I have yet to receive. The main issue that I have with them is that on my Equifax report they are reporting as the ORIGINAL CREDITOR. On XXXX and XXXX they are reporting correcting	1
which I incurred from dropping courses after the withdrawal date. This debt was appropriately included in my Chapter XXXX schedule F	1
which I just got.	1
which I made in the branch before the due date	1
which I never received even after contacting the XXXX County Court in XXXX & XXXX. The only statement I got from the court was to keep contacting Fredrick J Hanna '' s office because as an officer of the court they could n't advise me on this case. I have contacted my financial institution regarding all payment records regarding this matter and I will be able to get them and forward them when it is necessary. On XXXX XXXX	1
which I never received even after contacting the XXXX County Court in XXXX & XXXX. The only statement I got from the court was to keep contacting XXXX XXXX XXXX office because as an XXXX they could n't advise me on this case. I have contacted my financial institution regarding all payment records regarding this matter and I will be able to get them and forward them when it is necessary. On XXXX XXXX	1
which I never received. I only received a copy of a billing statement with an address I never lived	1
which I never received. Months later another woman calls and again refuses to send me anything	1
which I never received. They have my email address and my phone number but they did not utilize either ; only mail.	1
which I paid in full before the due date. Now I find it lowered my credit score to no fault of my own.	1
which I pay more than the minimum payment and all on time. I am not sure what they consider "" aged accounts ''	1
which I pd. Suddenly I rec 'd a XXXX XXXX bill of {$1000.00} after paying {$980.00} & a late pmt on my credit for XX/XX/XXXX. Nobody can tell me why.	1
which I promptly did.	2
which I promptly faxed to them. I called them once again	1
which I provided. They then stated that in order to cash the check	1
which I qualified for due to my income	1
which I recently sent again. I became XXXX in XXXX	1
which I reluctantly did since the lower payments would enable me to pay the higher taxes. No sooner had I done that when they then said I could n't refinance the loan because I did n't have a homestead exemption on the property XXXX miles away that is in no way connected to this loan.	1
which I reported ( or so I thought ) online. I called back a week or so later	1
which I requested they immediately close. Still	1
which I resent and am well aware of. I never asked for a PayPal credit card. I have never wanted a PayPal credit card. I have never received a PayPal credit card. I have never activated a PayLap credit card. I have never used a PayPal credit card. In short	1
which I returned later and when I spoke with time warned I was told by their representative that my account was at a {$0.00} balance after receiving the modem. And the negative info was removed from my credit report.	1
which I then did as each of the XXXX items posted. First item was a {$400.00} transaction at a pharmacy. The XXXX item was a {$220.00} charge at a restaurant in XXXX. The third transaction was at a XXXX for about {$4.00}. The fourth was another XXXX XXXX transaction for about {$3.00}. And the last was a {$16.00} cab ride in XXXX. All happened on the same day	1
which I thought was only for the batteries. However	1
which I understand. However	1
which I was never given. The investigating officer ( XXXX ) gave me a contact number which no one ever picks up. I received a letter from their attorney who is ready to put my home up for sale through the county Sheriff office. I contacted ASC attorney within the ten days as requested notifying them how I was going to secure the loan. I stated in the letter I am applying for a home loan modification with ASC I have yet to hear anything from ASC or the investigating officer and today date is XXXX/XXXX/2015. I believe my rights to secure a loan modification has been violated. Promises to grant a loan modification	1
which I was promised within 30 days of them receiving my paperwork	1
which I was pursuing through XXXX. This is erroneous and further more insulting when Portfolio Recovery Associates provided very little information	1
which I was supposed to have received at some point in the past. I believe there was mishandling on my account regarding this matter. The representative was rude and not cooperative at all. Citi simply refused to provide information that they based their decision upon	1
which I will be doing later today.	1
which I would be happy to pay	1
which I would get a response in 30-60 days! I am NEVER late on my bills and need them to remove this late payment	1
which I would not have ever needed. Now	1
which I would not if this claim was valid.	1
which I would then be held to	1
which Wells Fargo has still not resolved	1
which XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
which XXXX XXXX never disclosed	1
which XXXX XXXX never returned to me	1
which XXXX notified that they paid for. My account was forwarded to this collection agency Franklin Collection Service	1
which XXXX said would make the rate prime -.25 % and all fees to be waived. They also offered us {$500.00} upon settlement. We got a call to fax many documents	1
which XXXX said would not to be charged until my stay on XX/XX/XXXX was completed. Both the star rating and my Amex account not being charged until after XX/XX/XXXX were not true. On my arrival at the aforementioned XXXX I inspected the room I found that is was unfit for human use and did not sign in that room nor did I stay at that XXXX. When I received my XX/XX/XXXX Amex STMT I learned that XXXX at XXXX incorrectly charged my Amex account on XX/XX/XXXX for the {$66.00}	1
which according to the FTC was time-barred debt. I am writing to dispute this and have it removed from my credit report as it is preventing my wife and I from refinancing and buying a new home. I feel as if I were well informed and went to court ( assuming is was actually a real and legitimate case ) that this would have been resolved and this negative item would have never reached the bureaus.	1
which accounts for about 90 % of the entire tax liability. Now even though I have sufficient fund in my escrow account	1
which added more delays. The single points of contact failed to look at the paperwork provided and would ask me to resubmit paperwork because I had provided so much paperwork ( which was result of their frivolous attempts to delay ). Four months later	1
which added to the excess in our escrow account.	1
which after this we do n't know what happened? We did n't receive any letter/notice from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.	1
which again may harm my credit. This has to stop. I am sure that this company has had numerous complaints and it is not okay that I have to now spend many more hours of my life trying to pay something that should take 30 seconds. I want my debt gone from this company and to never have to deal with them again.	1
which allowed the transfer to occur	1
which amount to XXXX	1
which appears to have a turnover rate of new employees every few weeks. Not only that but they allow accounts to go negative and bounce checks without notifying you so that they can clandestinely collect a fortune in fees. Please urgently assist.	1
which are paid on time	1
which are then not given.	1
which are two examples of billing errors that must be enforced by Creditors	1
which at one time was XXXX Mortgage. When XXXX Mortgage was not properly distributing my funds and I could not get them to respond to me	1
which at the height of the Housing Crisis in XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX	1
which at the time was XXXX and evidenced by Wells own record.	1
which at this point seems irresolvable.	1
which because I get paid bi-weekly	1
which blew my mind since I was holding their appraisal in my hand ... Besides the fact that when we did our refi a few months back ( XXXX ) our mortgage holder appraised our house at XXXX More in line with the {$450000.00} TD Bank originally sent us.. When I asked where the {$380000.00} came from all our correspondence stopped.. Yesterday	1
which bought my mortgage	1
which by XXXX is around {$3200.00}.	1
which by law	1
which can not be seized at any point	1
which cause unbelievable damage to myself and my children. An employee of Bank of America at the time	1
which caused XXXX XXXX to impose a limit on that card	1
which caused a great deal of adverse circumstances including homelessness and potential exacerbation of a traumatic condition	1
which caused my to have an underage in my escrow..When I spoke with XXXX we agreed to take the escrow overage and break it into 24months	1
which charges a fee. Plus	1
which clearly put the account in over draft. The {$31.00} cleared the bank and {$200.00} deposit posted to the account XXXX/XXXX/2015. On Monday	1
which completely blew my mind. Being charged a {$15.00} fee to make a payment using my debt card is XXXX % robbery. I felt as though i was being strong armed because i needed to make a payment so i would n't be late but i only have a prepaid debt card. {$15.00} may not seem like alot to most people	1
which concerns me for Fair Lending. I also explained that the score does not reflect the recent XXXX mortgages paid in full and as agreed on XXXX/XXXX/2015 for {$500000.00}. The refinancing company also sent the XXXX to show those mortgages are paid and closed as proof and verification.	1
which confirmed the total payment amount was indeed received on XXXX XXXX	1
which contained a printed statement from the original creditor. The printed statement does not show my correct name or address. I contacted the original creditor with regards to the debt	1
which contains an escrow waiver. To supposedly substantiate their claim	1
which contractually should be 1 % of the outstanding balance was now {$89.00} instead of the {$32.00} is should be. This was because B of A was adding the late fee and "" past due amount '' to the minimum amount due ( {$32.00} + {$25.00} + {$32.00} = {$89.00} ). I have contacted Bank of America 's customer service multiply times and have been told that there is nothing that they can do. I feel that it is an unfair and deceptive practice for a company to tell a customer that they have a payment due and after the customer makes the payment	1
which could cost me thousands of dollars in the end. I asked for a letter stating the matter had been reversed with the Credit Bureau but they would n't give me one.	1
which could track down my loans	1
which covered all tuition	1
which covered their interest on my XXXX mortgage with a principle balance of approximately {$4900.00}. Not only did the annual premium amount change	1
which did not ahppen.. Still no check was forthcoming so I called and was told I would now need another inspection which was completed and I was then told my contractor must sign a lein waver which he did. Then they sent me my {$25000.00} in form of a check made out to myself and my contractor. No bank would accept the check and I asked them to re issue the check in just my name as they had an inspection showing the work was completed and they had a lien waver from the contractor so they knew he would not place a lien impacting their colateral. I was then told I needed to provide a letter from the contractor saying the bill was paid in full and he was not owed any more money. I then provided this to the mortgage company who said I need to return the original check to them before they would reissue the check	1
which disqualified me from the promotion	1
which does not allow access to my USAA accounts to change how I pay my bill and do other critical things.	1
which does not allow me to view the payments that are being applied to my account. In his letter	1
which does not validate the accuracy of the debt. I am still receiving notification stating that I owe the debt even though the law states otherwise.	1
which effectively prevents any borrower from bringing a claim against them. I would be happy to represent myself against them	1
which ended up being a generic looking document on their letterhead	1
which enforces fair credit reporting by the credit bureaus. To date	1
which estimated a value of {$240000.00}	1
which expired in XX/XX/XXXX. I was n't aware that if I had a missed payment I would get all the interest charged on the account. Well back to my four months of not being able to make payments	1
which failed.	1
which formerly were given free. I was told by a cashier that they could be ordered FOR A PRICE	1
which further delays every aspect of communication since we almost always go to voicemail. The approval from the XXXX in XXXX was stalled by the XXXX asking for another appraisal that had to be paid for upfront by the seller and it took more than two weeks to get an appraiser to the home. We found out later the appraiser was told the appraisal was for a loan refinance and not for what it really was. The XXXX mortgage representative told me that this was all a formality to pressure the first mortgage to give the max they were allowed of {$6000.00} due to it being a XXXX XXXX loan. The XXXX mortgage confirmed this and then offered {$6000.00} as a max amount	1
which give her ownership of property 100 %. This property went into foreclosure this month XXXX XXXX	1
which had a {$300.00} line of credit. On that date	1
which had always been used to pay Bill Me Later ) and I never thought about it again until I received phone calls from PayPal looking for payment for purchases I made 8 months ago and two months ago. I did receive a couple of emails from PayPal in XXXX	1
which had not deposited as of the date of said meeting on XXXX XXXX	1
which had only accumulated to XXXX and I was told that the account was put on hold pending eligibility. I informed them that I was indeed XXXX XX/XX/XXXX however my paperwork was in IL in a storage locker and I can not provide it. I was very upset because the account had been opened so long and I had NOT ever been contacted and now my funds were on hold	1
which happened only at the time that Nationstar initially transferred the loan over from XXXX	1
which has a XXXX monthly maintenance fee associated with it. I only saw the change when I was reviewing my account statement	1
which has already cleared my bank? I feel that they are holding my title	1
which has always been the case. This was done automatically until 3 years ago. For the past three years on my anniversary date the interest rate has not been decreased until I call and write letters to have the issue resolved. Since this has happened for three consecutive years	1
which has been a nightmare from the start. My HAMP paperwork clearly states "" The terms of your Trial Period Plan and your Modification Agreement will REQUIRE us to establish an Escrow Account if your loan does not already have one	1
which has had a devastating impact on my credit rating. I have always had perfect credit. I acted in good faith to fulfill my obligation as a co signer. Wells Fargo has acted in bad faith	1
which has increased my auto insurance	1
which has not been answered yet. The modification was done in XX/XX/XXXX	1
which has prevented me from successfully obtaining a mortgage for my Home purchase for my family. Once again	1
which has since been revoked. This is relevant as he is currently occupying the property and has sent threating voice mails to the seller stating Chase has given him authority to live in the home through the end of the year on her dime. In the meantime we are trying to submit an offer to Chase for short sale review. The current buyer is cash and understands the title issues and plans to file a quiet title lawsuit against the renter/partner to remove the unsecured Deed of Trust from the property and remove him from the premesis. I have been trying to obtain a soft decline in Equator to upload the new offer since XXXX/XXXX/15. You will see in my notes the numerous attempts to have an offer task sent to us to upload the new offer including management escalations and there is nothing but ignoring our request and non response. I am a short sale facilitator of 8 years and constantly tell my clients the process is not a conspiracy but simply the process. But after the threatening voice mails and then this behavior by Chase	1
which has the collection agencies account numer and phone number listed right there.	1
which have XXXX now expired. At this point	1
which have been accrued due to them not coming to a decision on how to assist me.	1
which have been sent to them in a timely manner. Every time that I called them to find out more information about the case they switch me to a line that no XXXX answers. It has been more than two months that I have been working with them and until now I have not received an answer from the department. The only phone call that I received told me that I need to pay a month 's rent because if the house goes for more than 3 months without pay the case will be sent to another department and some lawyer fees may apply. They then told me that the case would be more difficult to work on. Since this process started and no decision has been made	1
which have gone un-resolved as I am now/currently receiving harassing phone calls by their company regarding payment on XXXX of my XXXX Barclaycard credit cards.	1
which have only added to my balance and adds to interest paid. I am sending a letter to Wells Fargo along with a repayment request worksheet	1
which he did to tell me XXXX would be giving me the loan. A person from XXXX called and asked me to verify my information. Then tells me that this is a loan company I 'm borrowing from and there will be a {$480.00} fee to pay before I can get this money transferred to my account. I refused and called back to XXXX XXXX XXXX for a refund because that is not what I was told from the beginning. XXXX XXXX continues to tell me if I pay this {$480.00} they will deposit money in to my account. This is the information given me. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX Fla. XXXX	1
which he did. I paid my XXXX payment on time using the coupons he emailed me.	1
which he said in its entirety over the phone. They also had an old address and the bank I belong to. I was threatened if I didnt pay XXXX in 10 days that my wages would be garnished and I would be taken to court	1
which helped a lot. But for some reason	1
which helped significantly	1
which hindered me from getting a copy of credit bureau reports and the deletion of erroneous information. My consumer credit rights	1
which i did not receive.	1
which i was not getting anywhere with their reps and left a message for a tax specialist within their dept to call me. This past weekend we received ANOTHER mortgage statement of an huge increasement in the amount of {$3500.00} to start on XXXX XXXX	1
which i will keep for my records. Enhanced recovery intentionally ignored my debt validation request	1
which i would pay without a wage garnishment claim. This can be settled in a honest and fair way	1
which in and of itself causes an inaccuracy on the credit report which would equate to it having to be removed or updated due that. upon asking for a supervisor on several phone calls from myself to pinnacle credit bureau	1
which in turn negatively affects the interest rate ( higher rate ) I am able to obtain on the refinance	1
which in turn took until XXXX of XXXX to complete. In the mean time she was making all payments as requested by XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
which included a life insurance policy payment of {$120.00} covering both myself and my wife which was included and paid to HSBC in XXXX check with each bi-monthly mortgage payment. A total of {$940.00} ( every 2 weeks ). I could have taken a widow 's benefit on my pension	1
which includes redeeming rewards points that I have now lost over XXXX because of points expiring	1
which includes the lender fees saving as of XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
which indeed it was NOT. I 've been contacting this company about this issue since XXXX/XXXX/15 exactly one day after this incident occurred. I spoke with XXXX in the XXXX Carolina office on XXXX/XXXX/15 she stated their regional office will contact me via email. I never heard from the company. I then called Naca again on XXXX/XXXX/15 and spoke with XXXX in the North Carolina office and she stated she will file another complaint with their regional office and someone should give me a call back. I received a call back that same day ( XXXX/XXXX/15 ) from XXXX. XXXX stated XXXX told me the wrong information and there is nothing they can do about it. I 've ask the company to review their cameras in XXXX 's XXXX	1
which indicated Barclay Credit Card received the remaining payment of {$16.00} on XXXX XXXX	1
which indicates that Trans Union has erroneous information about my credit history that is having a detrimental effect on my credit score and status	1
which indicates they decided not to investigate my complaint. I believe this a blatant violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and was an effort to intimidate and coerce me into not pursuing the correction of faulty information on my credit report. I wish to file a complaint against them.	1
which is "" XXXX '' ( which corresponds with the last XXXX digits of a person 's Social Security number ) does not match mine. In addition	1
which is 6 years before I ever had XXXX. Not to mention what they claimed I owed was for receivers I sent back through the company 's mailing process and 2 months of service which I could n't have used since I cancelled it and I did n't have the receivers because I had moved from the service address.	1
which is CASE # : XXXX as they are showing this as charged off in XXXX 2015 now and at the time I complained to the CFPB they were showing it as charged off XXXX 2015. This is just illegal XXXX that I am tired of and XXXX says it will take 60 days and I know XXXX well they have the updated info already as it was mailed to them about a month ago yet they are still reporting this XXXX account incorrectly and illegally	1
which is FCRA 605B. I find it odd that Equifax gave a different result.	1
which is XXXX of their premium credit card services. I believe Bank of america is intentionally trapping younger generations into deceptive credit card agreements	1
which is a blatant violation of the FCRA. The debt was mine	1
which is a budget breaker. Of the several credit cards that I have accepted a balance transfer offer from	1
which is a certain percentage of my military check.	1
which is a collection agency. The collection agency contacted us and we asked for validation of the debt as we have all of our insurance statements and did not believe we owe this debt. We never received verification. After making recent inquiries into our credit reports	1
which is a common and encouraged practice. The company subsequently	1
which is a few days early. These loans were for XXXX XXXX XXXX.	1
which is a option without fees. Again	1
which is a subsidiary of XXXX XXXX	1
which is a violation of my right to dispute inaccurate account pursuant to the FCRA. The bureaus are known for this and although it may work with someone else	1
which is absolutely false. I have made every payment in full	1
which is after my submission was confirmed on XXXX/XXXX/2015. Even though XXXX has been made aware that I am under an active review for loss mitigation	1
which is against the law.	1
which is almost as usurious as payday lending.	1
which is also being filed with the CFPB and the State of Ohio Attorney General 's Office.	1
which is also false. I contacted the Court and they told me these records are not being validated properly yet each time I get a letter from Experian	1
which is also holding me back from being able to raise my current credit card limit	1
which is backed by XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
which is blatantly false. They could not offer me a HARP refinance with them unless I met the qualification for ownership by XXXX or XXXX XXXX. They are simply withholding my loan information for their own benefit to force me to refinance with them. Since then I researched online for fraud complaints with Bank of America and there is no shortage of news on the subject ( check out XXXX among many others ). There is evidence that they have been consistently involved in fraudulent activity regarding the TARP program	1
which is causing undue expense and hardship to the buyer.	1
which is completely illegal.	1
which is completely unacceptable. I am requesting my credit line be reinstated to its previous amount.	1
which is crazy to me. On Monday XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
which is currently on the market. When I purchased my first home	1
which is currently {$250000.00}. '' Where as my mortgage contract states on page XXXX '' 1. The Borrower ( s ) must provide satisfactory evidence of hazard insurance coverage and flood insurance coverage if the Property is located in a special flood hazard area.	1
which is customary. The payment was scheduled to be delivered on XXXX/XXXX/2015	1
which is different from the subject property address.	1
which is far too long into our future	1
which is from Experian.	1
which is has not. According to the FDCPA	1
which is helpful	1
which is hurting my credit report in a major way. They are refusing to report the balance to be {$0.00} even though it is a charged off	1
which is impossible since no one has accessed our key box XX/XX/XXXX. There is apparently FRAUD going on here because the negotiator will not investigate this discrepancy or find out why the BPO agent stated this was a recent value. I sent the negotiator the inspection report along with color pictures. bids to repair this work along with the buyers counter offer XXXX. The new assessors value for taxes show the value to be about XXXX which is FAR less than the XXXX value that they have place on it under a BOGUS valuation. This is fraud!	1
which is in another state	1
which is incorrect.	1
which is incorrect. A collections company should not be reporting a charge off status as they were not the ones who extended the credit to begin with	1
which is incredible. Then they ask my friend to recall that check	1
which is insured through my XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX never asked for this ). Every time Ocwen has asked for this I have submitted the proof of insurance as supplied by my property management company and their insurance partner. However	1
which is just a bad joke. How is possible that other CRAs XXXX and others have conducted their investigations	1
which is less secure than me emailing it over my https XXXX account. ) I faxed this information in on the same day	1
which is listed with the REO agent XXXX XXXX. License number is XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX ; on XXXX XXXX 2015. My Realtor was told that they Had a several offers over the Listing Price. Now the property is back on the market and is Listed XXXX below the previous Listed price and my prior offer. The Realtor now is saying that she has offers again	1
which is mathematically inconceivable : If the interest does n't change and the balance is reduced	1
which is more than enough to ensure that I will pay off my balances each month. I ask Paypal to review my XXXX Credit history to see that I have continuously paid you back on time	1
which is more than what the actual fees came out to. Instead of the dealership or XXXX finance resolving the matter	1
which is my servicer and this was what they offered : they want me to come up with {$8600.00} up front	1
which is n't on my copy of the note. GT added another {$1000.00} on the note at {$39000.00} and not the purchase agreement price of {$38000.00}.	1
which is n't true. He made up something in his head that should not affect your decision. To go back on your initial decision and then hold me responsible over XXXX months later. XXXX has repeatedly lost my disputes and they admittedly lost this one as well. However	1
which is next to nothing. For reference	1
which is nonexistent	1
which is not correct I know of other people who have been through this process	1
which is not even close to the value of the fee. I recently found out that the representative who spoke to me was either misinformed or lying	1
which is not mine. I gave NCS sixty ( 60 ) day right to cure my notice.	1
which is not much. But I believe these are shady business practices. I have emails but can not get them attached ... The sum of {$7.00} is broken into the following in my FROST BANK account - {$4.00}. XXXX	1
which is not my responsibility to supply to them. They bought the servicing	1
which is not possible. I do n't understand how they can refuse to even CONSIDER working with me or helping me or looking at my current financial situation	1
which is not the case because cur based on Bank of America NPV report our credit score is XXXX. In today 's credit score requirement any person can qualify for a XXXX XXXX	1
which is now costing me thousands of dollars in back end interest.	1
which is now six months old. Reading the fine print again	1
which is now.	2
which is off by {$11.00}. But I have to pay the {$11.00} because this charge is valid. If the employee ( S ) make a mistake	1
which is only 6 weeks away my rates will be increase again..What can I do here? What laws are there to protect me	1
which is over 1 1/2 years ago and prior to Ditech servicing of Greentree accounts ( which began 2 months ago ). Therefore	1
which is owned by their institution. So I am still dealing with the same headache of not being able to open a checking account which is hindering my life and costing me a lot of money. I have tried appealing again to their fraud department with no luck. I do n't want an account with them	1
which is past that time period. I still have n't received any response from Seterus as I keep getting the run around am I 'm paying much more each month in my impound account that I need to. Also	1
which is permissible under the Federal Reserve System. I have no problem providing forensic audits and securitization reports. I want justice and my home. Freedom is n't free!!	1
which is preventing me from moving on with my life and securing a new mortgage on a lesser home 3.5 years later. I am told that they must record the mortgage status as foreclosed or written off	1
which is reflected on my credit report	1
which is required. At that time I was told that now I qualified to be reviewed for HAMP and that 's why they were requesting additional documentation. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I called and confirmed the documents were received and submitted to underwriting for review. On XX/XX/XXXX	1
which is ridiculous. We were expecting to a few month 's worth of interest as a penalty.	1
which is ridiculous. Why would I pay {$10.00} on a $ 6k loan? Not to mention	1
which is roughly half my paycheck. And I live in XXXX	1
which is secured by my primary residence located at XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
which is subject to an additional {$10.00} fee AND the much inflated interest rate for Cash Advances. First	1
which is telling Wells Fargo employees that I am waiting for these documents and working with the Office of the President to refinance my loan. This is a lie. I would like this to be investigated.	1
which is the customer service phone number listed on my mortgage statement ... XXXX.	1
which is the financial policy	1
which is the lesser of The maximum limit available for the type of structure ( {$250000.00} for a residential structure	1
which is the time when I could have saved for or attempted to pick up a second job. I only get calls when they want money. They call every day	1
which is time consuming at best	1
which is to pay my bills on time.	1
which is very unusual and objectionable. After which	1
which is well below the amount owed to the investor.	1
which is what alerted me to a problem. After resolution of this last complaint	1
which is what he said that I would come out to being if I did n't pay by today but no later than tomorrow. I will lose everything that I have worked so hard to get and at the moment keep. Again this is XXXX XXXX who said that he is an attorney and XXXX.	1
which is what they have done.	1
which is why I 'm eligible for my refund. I can not afford to give away any more of my money. Please speak to them on my behalf. They have not considered the matter at all.	1
which is why I truly believe it is a huge error that someone is trying to make may pay for someone else 's debt. Please advise how I can resolve this issue.	1
which is why most credit card companies have a 25+ day grace period. Even if they mailed out my statement ending XXXX XXXX 2015	1
which is why they sent me a check in the first place	1
which it decided to do since it was no longer able to keep the project property maintained ( after 15 years it needs to be re-capitalized and renovated ) and could not procure new financing itself. The outstanding balance of the loan is about {$280000.00}. With that	1
which it did on Monday XXXX XXXX. Before the {$850.00} cleared	1
which it is not. As a result my payment was raised for a year.	1
which it should be much lower.	1
which it should not be marked as such. I am requesting the current status be changed to "" paid and closed '' or "" pays as agreed '' or "" closed ''. Equifax said they contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX said that 's how the file should be marked as. Thank you for your assistance.	1
which it was built XX/XX/XXXX. We have been told it is our insurance company who she is waiting on to be able to order a closing date and when we contacted the insurance XXXX was told he too was waiting on a closing date. We confronted our lender and was told the closing date is taking so much time because we did not submit an employment letter until XXXX XXXX and again on XXXX XXXX. We have asked our lender to be honest with us and to communicate effectively with by keeping us informed about the loan process. We have contacted her supervisor	1
which it was confirmed. I called as well and was told on XXXX that the check had been issued and had been overnighted. On XXXX	1
which lead to them threating me about reporting on my credit. I responded in writing asking for verification	1
which leads me to believe they are deliberately trying to XXXX me.I 've tried calling the one number & it does'nt go through.The other number I 've used	1
which led this case into foreclosure to begin with. The Attorney General 's Office indicated the need to contact the Office of the Comptroller of Currency who said they have alerted your offices to this matter. This complaint is being made to validate their concern on this particular case and to bring overall resolve to this issue.	1
which made me scared and feared for my personal security. So I made the next payment with my credit card only after speaking to them and they promised again to remove my debt. They began accessing my student loans	1
which made my loans even further behind. I spoke to a supervisor on XX/XX/XXXX who assigned an agent to help re-enter me into the program and I paid {$170.00} to bring both loans up-to-date. Today XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Navient saying I again was kicked out of the program because the XX/XX/XXXX payment was not received even though there was knowledge their agent made the mistake. The agent requested I bring both accounts up to date and that the {$140.00} agreed upon XX/XX/XXXX was incorrect. She offered to put me into another program but wanted me to bring the loans current. At this point	1
which made no sense as the loan had been paid off. I have called them repeatedly over the past two months	1
which made our mortgage current and out of foreclosure. We have been trying since XX/XX/XXXX to get information from BSI Financial on our loan details. They are not sending us statements or giving us any information. We filed bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX and have continued to make our mortgage payments with XXXX XXXX XXXX since then. Now BSI is telling us they will not send us statements because our home was included in the bankruptcy yet we have continued to pay it and was reaffirmed. My husband had to send a letter to BSI Financial requesting monthly statements and also he had to say that he understood they were for informational purposes only. We have been trying to make our XXXX XXXX house payment which is what is due. We have gotten nothing but the run around from BSI Financial. They keep saying our house is in the active foreclosure process yet the payments are current. I have called numerous times	1
which makes it impossible to get a loan. When I attempted to get a copy of my credit report via mail	1
which may cause me to have to come up with an additional {$4300.00}. Also	1
which mean he would hear all of my bank login information via the conference call. The caller ID read ( XXXX ) XXXX.	1
which means all of my transferring meant nothing	1
which means someone is using my information to continuely open a new XXXX account in my name. I have tried to file a dispute with Trans Union but their website does n't allow it and I called there XXXX number to file a complaint they took my information but nothing has happened. I have also filed a dispute with XXXX and it has n't been removed my report either.	1
which means that I remain eligible for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX presently. The denial ( attached for your review ) clearly states that I failed to return the final modification agreement	1
which means they are tresspassing! The next time I catch anyone on my property	1
which meant my spouse and I are now out {$1500.00} a month. His response to this was to threaten wage garnishment	1
which my employer did not fill out or return to them. On XXXX	1
which necessitated several unhelpful trips to the branch. It finally started to happen with XXXX payments being taken out of our XXXX XXXX account on the XXXX and XXXX of XXXX	1
which negatively impacts my credit. I have had the card for almost seven years	1
which never happened. I asked them to delete the bank account and contact the collection company	1
which never really made sense to me. I was told that it took several years for the principal amount to decease. My last visit to the bank to inquire about this was in XX/XX/XXXX. I had gone into the bank and or called previous to XX/XX/XXXX	1
which no one would know about without calling them and waiting. This worked	1
which now claims my debt is XXXX plus XXXX in unpaid interest. There is no way this is even possible. Ten days ago	1
which now claims my debt is {$93.00} plus {$18.00} in unpaid interest. There is no way this is even possible. XXXX days ago	1
which offered me the best alternatives. With undergoing these changes and lower rates	1
which only left me 2 mortgage payments behind	1
which over {$3500.00} was included in my contract. I 've found monetary discrepancies & fallacies in my mortgage contract along with exorbitant charges through having a Forensic Audit done. The mortgage contract claims to be a fixed rate but in actuality is a variable rate. This is supposed to be an FHA loan but I can find no record of it. I 've contacted the Title agency	1
which paid half of XX/XX/XXXX payment. i still owed the other half of XX/XX/XXXX and my loan was transferring to us bank starting XXXX XXXX was told by caliber to stop the biweekly automatic payment which I did.	1
which passed to my brother without having to go to probate. I was named personal representative of my father 's estate	1
which posted to the card on XXXX XXXX	1
which proved to be false also. XXXX XXXX XXXX was already offering many benefits to their members like me as I have Accounts with them for many years.. I am attaching their promotion flyer to me. Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America has been adding $ XXXXmonth in to my mortgage payment since the closing of mortgage on XXXX XXXX	1
which quickly increased in payments. We refinanced to what we thought was fixed only to learn it was another interest only loan with a XXXX Arm. When we tried to correct this Ocwen would not cooperate	1
which readjusts in XX/XX/XXXX	1
which reflects my credit card utilization ratio.	1
which rejected it the first time completely	1
which resulted in credit being adversely affected. Thereafter business loans could not be obtained.	1
which resulted in late fees that I am currently refusing to pay and disputing. I have good reason to believe that they have intentionally "" lost '' my last payment as a form of retaliation for attempting to dispute their late fees. I will also be switching over their pay by phone system	1
which resulted in much higher prices	1
which score would be preferred from the mortgage company	1
which seems suspect at best.	1
which seems very favorable for them	1
which she could see that were included making the account with a negative balance. I asked her if she could send me that info and she replied no because it was internal use. I ask to speak to a supervisor who would have authority to reimburse full amount and she politely saw to my request. The Supervisor XXXX gave her full name but I did n't record her last. She ask how could she help. I advised her I wanted a full refund because my statement does n't show in my estimation that an overdraft was needed	1
which she did not acknowledge. On XX/XX/XXXX	1
which she feels is her only feasible option at this point to avoid foreclosure. XXXX has acted in good faith by listing the property at fair market value with a local real estate professional	1
which should generate a response within 30 days	1
which should have been corrected as : XX/XX/XXXX.	1
which should have been immediately applied to my balance. I then went to a store and made a purchase	1
which should have caught my attention	1
which should not reflect any late payments prior to filing a sole petition alone and without my husband to correct my BK-XXXX is WHY its very important to change the Account History date field on my credit report. Please make the necessary corrections	1
which showed a new debt. As a XXXX time homebuyer	1
which showed me why I kept being ignored and rejected each time I applied each time they requested to hire at the store. ) So I fell a bit behind on my cards	1
which shows the value to be above asking	1
which sounds like a form of "" kick back ''. I have friends that work for Wells Fargo who explained to me that loan officers on the XXXX XXXX accounts have special treatment not only by the builder but within Wells Fargo and makes much more in commission than other loan officers. They supposed get favorable treatment starting from pricing	1
which stated	1
which states it will go in my secure inbox within 3 days. They have now taken the three days comment down due to my complaints	1
which still was not foreclosed. I continued to pay homeowner 's insurance through XXXX XXXX XXXX until XXXX	1
which stipulates that a debt collector must	1
which takes approx. 30 days for each dispute. This means	1
which tells me it may have beensold or transferred to another servicer. I have not received anyof this via email ( preferred ) or regular mail. I now am two monthswithout a payment on the XXXX note because Ido not know who to pay. The servicer has beenOcwen and in trying to call they will not answer myquestions. I left a voice message : no response.	1
which the appraiser did not take care of before leaving on vacation for this week. We are requesting "" backup '' to see if the appraisal management firm can fill in for him on it	1
which the collection says is legal because the debt is for medical services my ex-wife received while were were married/separated. I was never billed by the office where services were received	1
which the last number I have seen on the caller ID many times.	1
which the promotional period is for	1
which their employee ( the teller ) knew had just been rejected by Citibank 's own ATM machine	1
which then the loan went into full agreement. Since XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX we have made our monthly payments on time yet Ocwen continues to report information of no payments being made to the credit bureaus. Ocwen also has been charging fees sometimes up to XXXX in one day as you can tell from the payment history from Ocwen. Ocwen has not and continues to place our payments into a separate account even when there was a modification present and payments were made on time and Ocwen will still not apply payments the day/month they are received. Attached you will see Ocwens negligence in reporting fraudulently to the credit bureaus and documentation of payment history. As you make notice of Ocwens payment history sheet they are fudging payment dates and dates the payments were applied and the late fees	1
which there was no way I could afford. I tried to do a loan modification with Nationstar	1
which they assure me will change.	1
which they ca n't do-so the tax tables have been provided	1
which they can not. Thanks for your help!	1
which they cant seem to provide. Also asked for a credit report where they had ran my credit	1
which they did	1
which they did on XXXX XXXX	1
which they explained as the result of a software upgrade. They offered to send me a paper statement that would arrive 3 days before my payment is do	1
which they failed to do that three times	1
which they refuse to consider an acceptable form of payment.	1
which they said I could not get at this time. Now I receive notifications that I should keep applying. I just want to move forward with the product I want.	1
which they say is within 48 hours and finally one of the reps told me they had closed my account in XXXX	1
which they say was to expire on XXXX XXXX. Today	1
which they should tell customers	1
which they stated they could not ( so they knew about this lien from the very start ). Since Ditech said they could not roll the amount owed on XXXX fees into the modification	1
which they swiped	1
which they will not do until the case has been reopened. It was stated in emails from my attorney between BOA	1
which they wont even qualify due to the expenses for the care of XXXX XXXX it would make more sense to offer a full forgiveness of the second loan.	1
which they would n't take. Due to this issue still not being resolved my credit has dropped significantly	1
which they would not do to other Americans consumers.	3
which they would not process from a vendor due to microtransaction withdrawals being denied. They then proceeded to close my account after 60 days as "" charged off ''	1
which they would not tell me. They kept saying that I needed to disclose the last XXXX of my SSN or the conversation would be over. That 's when I told them that it would be over because I would n't share it unless they told me what the call was about	1
which this is n't even a courtesy waiver! They can not charge XXXX overdraft fees for XXXX overdrawn transaction that was done days after any other transaction and after their cut-off processing times anyway. It 's ridiculous to think that banking regulations would allow such a robbery from the public. But even so	1
which to me I did n't because XXXX did not issue any credit card to me with their credit limit	1
which to my knowledge I do not. The phone system HSBC employs will also not allow callers to speak with a representative unless they either have an active account or lie about the nature of their call. In my case after a half-hour spent trying to navigate through their many menus and failing to get a live operator	1
which told me I would need to start the process all over again with new and updated information. My loan is currently held by SLS Mortgage which raised my mortgage rate to 6.675 % with only one week notice. I am now unable to afford my mortgage and they have advised that I will suffer foreclosure if I can not pay my mortgage. I have exhausted all of my savings and sold everything I possibly can to continue to make mortgage payments in full and on time. In order to keep my home	1
which told me to dispute it through the credit bureau and that they could n't do anything on their end. I disputed the information on Trans Union and when I checked my score on creditkarma.com it appeared to be resolved. This morning I checked my FICO score on XXXX and noticed it 's at XXXX	1
which took 5 days to receive while up against a XXXX/XXXX/15 payment/acceptance deadline.	1
which took months but it appeared to have been resolved with my only paying XXXX interest monthly. He promised to waive all the late fees and to provide me payment plan in writing	1
which totally makes sense	1
which usually results in my call being terminated. Can one of their corporate executives please justify this practice?	1
which usually takes place the next business day. In the past with not only wells Fargo	1
which was XXXX XXXX and changed without my knowledge until I was some how delinquent and owed a company I had never heard of money. I can not create a life worth living with this unreasonable debt. I make under XXXX a year	1
which was XXXX square feet lower than the XXXX that is on record with the county	1
which was XXXX/XXXX/15. They say I can not pay early and if I do	1
which was a LIE. He told her that they had no right to do that and that he wanted his money returned	1
which was a terrible offer that would have left me severely underwater	1
which was a total that included balance and interest. The guy also mentioned to settle the account "" Right AWAY '' with him via phone for {$2400.00} and that he will waive all the interest and charges fee. I replied by saying "" NO	1
which was after our HELOC 's maturity date ( copy of cover letter enclosed ). At no time did the representative tell me that I needed to submit the completed package before my loan 's maturity date. Had she done so	1
which was also frustrating due to me being at work during this call. I spoke with a supervisor named XXXX who took a quick look at the payment history and said the funds did n't post to the current payments because of the due date change in the beginning of my loan where I made a partial payment then the extension I did in XXXX 2015. I explained to him that XXXX as well as XXXX and my understanding on extensions is that the payments that are extended are placed at the end of the loan	1
which was also included in my letter	1
which was also secured by XXXX. They continue to call me weekly asking for payment.	2
which was an attempt to resolve these violations.	1
which was an over sight on my part. The account was closed. I have been fighting with this for years and BBVA Compass have not been helpful. They never informed me that I was reported to a company called XXXX XXXX Services. The overdraft on my account was simply an over sight. It was no way intended to cause fraud. I went into XXXX of the local BBVA Compass branches and spoke with a branch manager and I was given a print out of when the account was opened and when it closed. Keep in mind	1
which was bought out by XXXX XXXX XXXX at the end of my Bankruptcy in XXXX ; which in turn was handed over to SPS to service in late XXXX. In addition	1
which was denied/ignored. I continued to pay the modified amount	1
which was done so. I contacted chase landing services and my credit bureau file was pulled by the representative. Due to personal level of dislike against me or discrimination	1
which was done without my express or implied consent. I called to complaint and on XX/XX/XXXX I was finally able to speak to someone in the COMPLIANCE DEPARTMENT. I spoke with XXXX XXXX	1
which was due on XXXX XXXX. I requested the late fee be removed due to confusion over the holiday. The XXXX statement showed a balance of {$70.00}	1
which was established during the proceedings of the loan. The escrow was a requirement for disbursement of the loan. A schedule of financial disbursement from the escrow account was also within the loans associated paperwork. The loan was finalized on XX/XX/XXXX. My loan was then sold to Nationstar Mortgage and my first payment to Nationstar was recorded as XX/XX/XXXX. The next scheduled disbursement from my escrow to my insurance provider was to take place XX/XX/XXXX.	1
which was explained to BOA. BOA does not respond to e-mails they hav to send via portal which does not work on computer & their rep said it does not work on all comp	1
which was held at US Bank. Apparently US Bank did not close my account and kept my account open. US Bank then proceeded to charge me an account maintenance fee of {$4.00}. This {$4.00} maintenance fee	1
which was in no way communicated to us. We would have not refinanced at all if there were any changes to the PMI as we were working hard to pay the balance down so that amount could come back to us and not continue to be removed. The representative said that this is because of XXXX and that the amounts are different now. This is wrong and we need help in getting resolution to this matter and ensuring that Nationstar can not continue to take advantage of customers this way. This is a lie and gross manipulation tactics and we need your help to resolve.	1
which was in the account computer files	1
which was last XXXX XXXX. Had I known that there was an expiration date on their amount	1
which was later sold to XXXX XXXX	1
which was my grocery money	1
which was not available from my escrow due to XXXX checks being sent out without my authorization. I was able to cancel the homowners policy with XXXX XXXX right away so in this time period I had recieved a refund from them for the homeowners policy which i took and paid the policy through XXXX. At that time I finally got a copy of the dec page and sent this to XXXX XXXX to cancel the XXXX renewal policy which they told me I was unable to cancel because it was past the deadline. So at this point refunded to my escrow account should have been the funds for the homeowners policy and flood policy through XXXX XXXX which never went back due to fault of the loan company. The policy with XXXX XXXX had to stay in place for a year before cancelation since I was passed the cancelation period. So for the next year XX/XX/XXXX I had XXXX policies in place for my flood insurance. I believe this is the main reason why my escrow account is shorted and was at no fault to me. When the policy had to stay in place the XXXX dollars was not refunded to my escrow. So in the end there was the XXXX dollars for the flood policy and the XXXX for the homeowners policy that i paid to XXXX for the new policy	1
which was not performed in XXXX non-payment of approximately XXXX from escrow account ( homeowner insurance and county property taxes ). Although I have had Ocwen as my mortgage company since the beginning of XXXX and they had made payments to the insurance company and county through the escrow account since XXXX and I have incorporated the escrow in my mortgage payments and have paid my mortgage on time to Ocwen since XXXX. Ocwen claim that my escrow account was in the negative and the increase was required to pay the balance of the escrow of {$3400.00}. This recent increase in escrow payment does not appear to be legitimate and shows that fraud is occurring within Ocwen. The explanation by the Ocwen representative did not make any sense	1
which was not provided. When I contacted the agency	1
which was not supposed to collect interest.	1
which was not true. I have all of my reciepts and the release from XXXX which clearly shows I was current before and at the time of the transfer. When XXXX realized I was under chapter XXXX protection	1
which was not true. I never had to contact the company I was using to change my payment amount. The third party company has ALWAYS notified me regarding changes from the mortgage company annually	1
which was only XXXX days delinquent.	1
which was originally stated in the the first email. I originally meet XXXX at low income FHA seminar that was hosted by XXXX So now I 'm concerned that if I want to refinance in the near future that this could effect my interest rates.	1
which was overnighted to them with id	1
which was paid to M & T on XXXX XXXX	1
which was poorly encrypted.	1
which was received	1
which was sent on XXXX XXXX via email	2
which was strange to me because I had never seen anything like this before. I then called the USAA Federal savings bank to inquiry about this	1
which was supposed to be a forbearance in interest charges. That was outlined in our agreement. The other is for {$5.00}	1
which was supposed to be free repair per Ally booklet.	1
which was t	1
which was taken over by new management shortly before we vacated. Under the terms of the contract ( which I no longer have a copy of but requested from the collection agency	1
which was the date of my next paycheck. I remember that the amounts I paid were chosen by the representative -- I would have preferred to pay {$30.00} on XXXX -- but I suggested the XXXX date for the XXXX payment. I may not be remembering that fact correctly. I asked and confirmed with the representative how this would leave my account. The representative confirmed that this would bring my balance from {$90.00} that day to about {$35.00}	1
which was the date on which my credit card payment was due. I missed the date by four days	1
which was the reason they claimed the right to the house in the first place. I have attached emails with written confirmation of the payment arrangement I made with XXXX XXXX XXXX	1
which was their next reporting schedule to the bureaus. nothing was updated as of XXXX. I called them again and spoke with another rep. by the name of XXXX XXXX	1
which was unconscionable	1
which was unlikely. I even faxed a copy of the settlement letter as proof	2
which was very dissatisfying and depressing. I read online they make such offers	1
which was {$7500.00} and {$1500.00} per month for 3 month at that time a final modification if I was current. One week ago I gave them {$20.00} down and they raised my monthy payment {$2500.00} per month	1
which we believed was possible through the Home Affordable Refinance Program. The process was painful and repetitive	1
which we can not afford	1
which we can produce. TCF Bank has failed to provide any information about what happened with this account	1
which we complied to the last payment of the agreement	1
which we did. The payment arrangements did not fair well for us and our bankruptcy was dismissed. I then received info from XXXX regarding the mortgage abuse/mishandling of the well known banks that have since agreed to "" settlements '' for each victim of their schemes. I received XXXX checks each for {$300.00}	1
which we discussed with Carrington Mortgage. We completed the required paperwork and obtained a realtor to process the short sale. We moved out of the home in XXXX 2015 to prepare the home for viewing by potential buyers. The realtor submitted the short sale paperwork to our servicer. On XXXX XXXX	1
which we had also paid	1
which we haven't been able to get because of lack of transportation. I have been  working diligently to get the money I need to get my vehicle returned to me as it is very important. I feel that they should help me find financial assistance that will help me with my monthly payments so that they can get their payments. I'm currently seeking employment so that I can successfully make my payments and get the car payed off on my own	1
which we love	1
which we never received any financial or otherwise benefitted. We had an above average credit score and our 3 years tax returns showed our income supported the 28 % & 36 % monthly payment for {$1700.00} mortgage.	1
which we returned within only a couple of days. She never confirmed that she received the documents. She did	1
which we understood to be an addition to the daily rate. So far no problem. But when the Discover Card statement arrived	1
which went from XXXX XXXX to XXXX. I explained the story to XXXX and they entered those loan in manager review for 30 days	1
which went into effect on XX/XX/XXXX	1
which went out of business without notification to whom they had sold the loan. XXXX pocketed some of the payments before becoming insolvent. XXXX XXXX XXXX said they had purchased the loan and had XXXX different balances	1
which were also on the approval. The HUD had been submitted several times with neither the buyers closing costs nor the title fees being mentioned as an issue before yesterday. The buyer can not close without the closing costs as part of the deal. The fees the servicer is trying to negotiate or discount can not be as it is considered illegal to do so. All parties have signed. The buyers lender is ready to fund. My agents have complied with all the requests of the Servicer. They have emailed and left several voice messages to understand what is happening and have had no reply. This is suppose to close and record tomorrow	1
which were made directly to the bank	1
which were purchased as an investment property for our kids education. This company has also been sharing our information with adjacent neighbors in the area. Is n't this in violation of some federal laws? We are happy to provide any information necessary to resolve our issues. This company has been nothing but uncooperative and rude.	1
which were recorded by them	2
which when you do not have a job that is no help at all. At this point my savings account was drained and I could no longer keep up on the payments. I ended up moving to XXXX to be with my mom and dad so I would not be homeless. I again tried to do the right thing and called Nation Star to ask again if there was anything else that could be done otherwise I was moving and had to let the house go. I even asked if I could do a deed in lui of foreclosure. They were once again	1
which will affect my credit. At that point	1
which will become evident by the supporting information provided. On XXXX XXXX	1
which will deny me military access if the debt is not paid or cleared. I have never had XXXX	1
which will enable me to keep my home.	1
which will increase. I made several calls to Reverse Mortgage Solutions	1
which will make it stay on my report an additional XXXX years. I never became aware of this debt until I saw it on my credit report. Even though they have violated the rules set to protect consumers like me	1
which will make me only 15 days late. I am currently paying 7.5 % interest. Suntrust is my loan servicer and XXXX Bank is apparently my loan investor. I have filed all of the mortgage modification paperwork necessary. I would consider any option which would allow me to keep my home ; however	1
which will probably result in interest being accrued for another entire week	1
which will then cause there to be an outstanding balance	1
which would adversely affect my credit. Pay them or ruin my credit. I then requested a paper copy of my account history	1
which would allow me to continue to afford the payments. A modification was refused by PNC bank. I then made contact with HUD about my problem to find out programs I might be eligible for. HUD made contact with PNC regarding a modification	1
which would already put me outside of the 60 day-full-refund window. I have never opted for a payment protection plan on any products I 've purchased or financed via NFCU. This coverage is a one-sided payday for NFCU. As a 16 year XXXX Vet	1
which would be intolerable.	1
which would be refunded at closing	1
which would be then considered late	1
which would bring my NEW balance to {$12000.00}!!! But instead of CREDITING my account ... .Ocwen ADDED the {$180.00} payment and now my NEW BALANCE is {$12000.00}????!!!! Only Ocwen would ADD a credit to a balance and not DEDUCT it from the balance!!!!!!!!!!	1
which would cause PNC to lose forecasted interest payments and PMI.	1
which would come to about {$240000.00}. I asked the bank since there still is a lean for another 20 years	1
which would further damage my credit. In addition	1
which would have avoided the fee	1
which would have been for XXXX 's interest and MIP and then XXXX XXXX 's payment ( closing ) included all the interest and fees and that would have been payment for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. However	1
which would have resulted in further fees and more interest. Also	1
which would have resulted in me owing nothing on the card. In XX/XX/XXXX	1
which would have resulted in us owing nothing on the card. XXXX when the write-off showed up on credit report I began writing Discover and the credit reporting companies in an effort to have the charge off removed from my report ( see attached letters ). Although I received XXXX response to my XXXX requests	1
which would include more processes. He assured me that we would not be paying any of the closing costs for the second refinance	1
which would incur further bank fees. We called Nation Star to attempt to resolve. After being transferred several times and repeating the information and security questions several times and being on the phone for nearly 2 hours	1
which would leave me on the hook for the XXXX difference in auction price. At the last minute	1
which would require both signatures in order to write checks	1
which would take 30 days to get them to update then the information would be out of date again and I would have to start the process all over again. This should not be the case. I contacted both Equifax and both XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and XXXX ( XXXX ) and all of them passed the blame onto each other. XXXX and XXXX blamed and Equifax said they never received any information. So basically everyone was passing the buck and no one wanted to take any responsibility nor help resolve the issue. My last conversation with Equifax rep stated nothing they could due to get them to report accurate information other then disputing which I really did n't want to do as it does n't resolve the bigger issue but I said ok. Now 30 day 's later my 2 years of positive credit history with XXXX card has been removed from my Equifax report. This is unacceptable and I want this problem resolved permanently	1
which would take longer. I want the information updated and reported immediately	1
which would then allow them to make an informed decision about proceeding with the loan application process. XXXX XXXX made no effort to protect my interests in this matter	1
which you must repay is {$160.00}.	1
which you will see is a refusal to investigate my dispute because they viewed it as a "" suspicious request ''. It is my understanding that EXPERIAN 's tacit disregard of my request is in direct contradiction of FCRA	1
whichwould require us to pay in full or make additional payments over time.	1
while I am working	1
while I had Bank of America on the phone. The issuing bank	1
while I was charged an initiation fee of {$300.00} or so and also {$2.00} transaction fees for every payment. It appears as though everyone in this program was deceived. Please help.	1
while Midland claims otherwise	1
while Navient forwarded the request to a company called XXXX for review. Despite the federal approval and re-confirmation of my doctor certifying me as XXXX	1
while a contractor who was hired and paid by your company was supposed to rebuild the XXXX floor of the house	1
while also following up with a phone call later in the afternoon. I was advised my refund would be sent out no later than XXXX/XXXX/15. I questioned that and was told it was the company 's policy. Having worked in credit prior	1
while also trying to avoid any kind of delinquency but Navient is beginning to demonstrate some rather sketchy behavior. I feel helpless in this situation because I am trying to call	1
while another at the same location takes 8 days	1
while applying yet again to WF for review after THEY contacted me to reapply all the while they are DUAL TRACKING for foreclosure as I was just notified by a collections agent XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX as to foreclosure proceedings. Wells Fargo tells me that XXXX XXXX XXXX is the "" private investor '' on my mortgage	1
while depositing checks	1
while driving to Fl. and discussing the process I was strung along with other complications i.e. mandatory club fees and underage children on the property. When I arrived for the closing on XX/XX/XXXX I had no mortgage. I signed a promissory note with friends so that we could close. Soon after I re-applied with another mortgage company and had the process all over again ... .documentation	1
while in the process of sending in another set of documents stating that they would be transferring my loan over to Bayview Loan Servicing	1
while my bill is {$96.00}.	1
while simultaneously requesting an extension of time to comply with my QWR and TILA demands to produce additional documentation. See the attached XXXX letters from Wells Fargo Bank XXXX dated XXXX XXXX	1
while thinking they had the phone on mute. I have requested to speak to a supervisor.	1
while trying to open a new account that my name was in XXXX which came as a complete surprise. When I called the number given to me by the bank	1
while trying to setup XXXX XXXX	1
who I am told is no longer employed there. I told XXXX XXXX that I was instructed to tell her to call the fraud department before proceeding with opening up any new accounts. XXXX XXXX responded that she could see the notes on my file and there was no need to call. I expressed my concerns to XXXX XXXX that I had written checks on my current account and I did n't want them to bounce. XXXX XXXX stated that any checks written from that account would automatically be transferred to my new account for 90 days and that I had nothing to worry about. She also stated that my old account and savings were being closed and that I now have a new checking and savings account opened.	1
who I found is a corporate recruiter through XXXX. I have attached a copy of my ban statement which shows this.	1
who I have never heard of	1
who I was directly reporting to	1
who advised that he sees where the XXXX payments were made	1
who advised that malware was indeed downloaded on my computer by XXXX. I paid him {$99.00} to remove all malware from my computer.	1
who again faxed insurance information to Nationstar Mortgage. I again spent an hour on the phone speaking to two individuals ( XXXX assuring me this issue would be resolved	1
who again reversed the charges	1

I called CPD and requested the money to be returned since they were never authorized to take money from my account. CPD kept insisting that they needed to verify the funds were removed by talking to my bank or checking with my online banking or having me send them a bank statement. I refused all XXXX since they already have this in their system. I told them I was not going to give them any additional information since they had what they needed to get into my account. For some reason they kept insisting they needed the info so I asked for a manager since the agent was n't getting that they have the information including my {$310.00}. A manager named XXXX finally got on the phone and she requested the same info I told her know that they already have it so she is suppose to contact their research team to look into this and get back with me on XX/XX/2015 in the meantime my bank is blocking them from having access to my account under CastlePayday.com.

who was able to take my payment and waive the fee. I believe that Freedom Mortgage is deceptive in its practices by attempting to charge customers a fee for a payments when the option to make a free payment is not available due to the actions of Freedom Mortgage	1

So if this is another fraudulent account and you keep collecting on it and reporting to my XXXX credit repeorts then I will escalate this	1

whom was found liable due to mortgage fraud. Then on on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX the loan was transferred to Nationstar which is now being investigated by NEW YORK STATE Department of Financial Services due to improper fees	1
whom which services my mortgage loan. I contacted JP Morgan Chase to educate them of my current job situation and access their mortgage assistance programs. I was sent a packet to fill out and return with all documentation and proofs that was provided with the packet and that my customer assistance specialist had told me to fax in.  I did so right away as requested. After about 5 business days went by	1
whose name I have	1
why I can not get a copy of my report online. If I knew what the problem was I could fix it	1
why am I not allowed another chance? They say they would be lying if they told the credit reporting agency that we corrected this situation	1
why are n't you giving the attorney for the HOA a payoff amount and demanding payment? XXXX repeated "" I ca n't give you legal advice. '' On XXXX XXXX	1
why are there no records of eviction notices attached? An eviction notice does not entitle someone to be there for that length of period without consequences.	1
why are they allowed to continue to charge fees at ridiculous rates to keep people or worsen their credit building process. Im so confused	1
why are you trying to suspend my license? He said that he did n't want to hear anything other than if I was going to pay XXXX dollars. Then he could stop the process of suspending my license. I tried to ask the man why would you not validate the amounts and the accounts? He said that there is no time for all that	1
why cant I? I have blocked every number possible but they still get thru and leave numerous messages on both my cell and work voicemails. I am current with my XXXX mortgage and certainly do n't want to lose my house over a {$14000.00} loan that I can repay with a little assistance. They refuse to work with me and harass me every day of the week.	1
why did I just have 6 days to keep my house.	1
why did XXXX	1
why did it take 5 years to tell us? They now want over {$200000.00} to reinstate our mortgage. From XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX no one would even talk to me because they ( the bank ) said I had a "" subprime '' mortgage and only XXXX person could help us and he was not available for a year! He finally called me in XXXX XXXX then proceeded to tell me he had not worked there that long. I had a letter from him from XXXX XXXX. I found out a subprime mortgage is one that was one anyone could get without qualifying. Ours was a 30 yr. conventional mortgage from our credit union! We had to qualify and did not refinance when our house would have appraised at close to XXXX dollars. We paid our mortgage always. We have owned our own home since we were married XX/XX/XXXX. Never missed a payment on any of the homes we built and raised our children in. We even paid extra on this home payment so we could pay it off early. We have recovered from the Resession. We are both working. My husband worked for almost 30 years with XXXX when they closed overnight. We had a business and instead of filing bankruptcy we paid all our debt. We want to stay in our home. It is a catch 22. No one will refinance us because we are to far behind in our payments. We are so far behind because the bank would not accept our payments. When I called our worker in XXXX XXXX (	1
why did n't I receive any information indicating that a payment was missed until over two years later?? How can their attorney claim I missed XXXX payments and then Well Fargo Mortgage tell me "" it might have been XXXX or XXXX ''. I 'm received a Order on Motion for Relief From Stay from the Bankruptcy court so that they can file foreclosure proceedings. I think I have a right to information about the missed payments	1
why did they accept the documents just a few days before instead of telling me it was too late then so I could have sought other options. I understand I am behind and am trying to do everything I can to make my payments again and get some type of foreclosure avoidance but it seems no one wants to assist me.	1
why different name is showing on my Social security and why i am unable to obtain my credit report and why my credit file is frozen	2
why do I have to hire a lawyer to talk to their lawyer. My account is in good standing ; no late payments until now as I was advised not to pay XXXX that it would be rolled into the new loan. I sent XXXX payment to Green Tree today XXXX XXXX by on line banking as Green Tree refused to take payment by phone or allow me to do on line within their Green Tree system. I was told by Green Tree that if I did not pay by 30 days that it would go on my credit rating for seven years. My refinancing of my new loan is at a standstill without any explanation from Green Tree. I also faxed Green Tree to state what was going on my my account. No response. I sent message to Customer service within their Green Tree system. No response.	1
why do n't they give my share since we were XXXX people who used to live on the apartment	1
why do they continue to let any bill payments or merchants charge me	1
why do they keep calling and harrasing people that I know or have known in the past?? Like I said before I have a lot on my plate right now with the XXXX and all and going through treatment and DO NOT need this added extra stress in what I have left of my life.	1
why is Wells Fargo refusing to provide the necessary documents?	1
why it was opened 6 months after my lease ended with XXXX XXXX	1
why no one would call	1
why not continue to make your payments? '' What kind of company with any kind of morals would say that to a customer? At that point	1
why on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX did I contact American Express ( Amex ) at XXXX and was told not only by the person in charge of my account but by his manager also XXXX different things in terms of what is owed? The person who handles my account informed me that I owe {$660.00} and that I will be done with payments in XXXX of XXXX ; yet his supervisor tells me I owe XXXX more payments ( XX/XX/XXXX-would complete the XXXX payments ) of XXXX which is an amount of XXXX due to complete the payments-so says this supervisor?	1
why the bank reopened the account to process a transaction with neither my consent or authorization.	1
why the same "" math '' ( FICO score algorithm ) have not re calculated it? as now I do not have the "" wrong '' input!?	1
why was I declined the right to file a dispute on this transaction multiple times? If a dispute was filed	1
why when I call to apply they did not mention about that rule	1
why would I give them my bank account information? These people can barely formulate a sentence with proper grammar. On Fri	1
why would I have needed them at all. I expressed my desire to have all my funds returned to me immediately	1
why would I share my personal info with a 3rd party	1
why would that cancel my refund for something that was never to be charged in the first place? Preposterous! I asked to speak to a supervisor and she told me I was wasting her time and being argumentative. I asked to speak to someone above her	1
why? I do not know they have not given an answer. Our insurance premium is about {$150.00} a month	1
whywhy have the taken so long to release it	1
will actually follow through and make it happen. If they are going to make it so difficult to get onto paper billing	1
will be XXXX more XXXX insufficient fees subtracted from your account. So that would be XXXX more dollars subtracted from your account. Half of the tellers can not even explain to you why this is happening	1
will be over {$3000.00} because they do not apply the payments correctly. Your {$200.00} payment is going on XXXX different loans but you think it 's going towards that {$2000.00} loan. This is how interest grows and so does the amount of your loan. The people you call and talk to on the phone ... worthless.	1
will be {$40000.00}. My monthly payments are {$480.00} ( with exception of my first payment which was {$640.00} ) and are debited from my checking account each month. After making payments on my loan for the past two years	1
will cause me to lose my home.	1
will not agree to more than {$6000.00} to the XXXX. Neither one is willing to negotiate to conclude the short sale and the only one that will be hurt by this is myself and my husband	1
will not allow me to participate. I asked if I could at least get help with their other program that helps with relocation and moving expenses. I was again told that HSBC would not give permission for me to receive help there either. This is wrong! I originally had my loan with XXXX	1
will not issue a medallion stamp as I do n't have an account with them and would need to have an account for 6 months. I called Wells Fargo again today and was told the medallion stamp is necessary so they "" wo n't have to deal with the extra paperwork and I would just have to comply with the other agencies requests/guidlines. '' I explained my mother is very sick and I feel she is being denied access to her money so she can pay for the care she needs. She will be dead by the time six months is here and then the accounts will go into probate costing the family even more money. I was advised to keep making phone calls and find someone. They are not flexible. We are being denied access to our own money.	1
will not leave a message and sometimes I will hear music in the background. I have asked them to stop calling if no one will answer and they continue to do so. I have checked sites where there is complaints about this happening to them with this same number.	1
will not provide details on the alleged debt when asked	1
will synchrony restore the prior limit? Also	1
will the signature be a basis not to make claim or request a refund? If anything	1
will write to let me know what is going on with my account. This bank failed to do	1

with in {$20.00} of my true payment. They would not refi but told me to contact there mortgage modification. The modification dept. said they could not talk to me until I was 90days pass due. I stopped making payments and then contacted them again with no results. They would not redo my loan but could work my pass payments into a repayment plan along with my new tax problem. My payment then for the next 9 months would go up {$1000.00} per month. This company has destroyed my life	1
with it being reported that over {$6500.00} was paid towards interest. I paid off this vehicle in 16 months when it was a 50 month loan and it specifically states in the documentation that there is no penalty for paying off the vehicle sooner. Given the fact that I made payments of {$400.00} each month	1
with more penalties and fees after the rep told me and agreed to wait to make a payment until I talked to a supervisor and a resolution was found to the above issue. I have been charges in excess of {$190.00} in fees alone for making my payments	1

with multiple certified letters and mailings! I have spoken to different agents in this company and all give reasons that make no sense whatsoever as to why my payments are being returned. This company has XXXX of complaints against them in regards to sketchy practices.. OCWEN Mortgage is the company. I have all my bank statements proving I have sent the mortgage payments. I will be seeking legal action against this company if they continue to send my mortgage payments back as I truly feel they are trying to illegally take my home. There is no plausible reason why I have paid my mortgage and my payments are being returned unless there is some underlying scheming going on!	1

with no result. Finally I hang up and dialed TD bank 's customer service again. The next agent was more cooperative and transferred me to the supervisor sooner. The male supervisor spoke to me rather arrogant and said that the bank would not refund the fee. The whole communication with TD bank was just a hassle. And I still understand that the fee was charged unfairly.	1

Now I am being denied the ability to refinance at this time because I can not show that I was the rightful owner of this property prior to XXXX/XXXX/XXXX when my children quit claimed their fathers interest to me. I am just sick of this company and the way this company misleads and XXXX over customers. I am technically being forced to remain with this company because I can not secure financing with another reputable company because I have to wait anywhere from 6 - 12months to refinance	1

yet the auction continued. The loan could also be considered predatory in nature as the mortgage amount {$1600.00} / mo. leaves a household of XXXX well below the National Guidelines for Poverty.	1
yet the collection agency was not included in the trustee 's list. Perhaps because it was not a valid claim? To add further insult to injury	1
yet the continue to report this account on the consumers credit report every month as an unpaid debt. The debt is nearly 6 years old. Their conduct is unfair	1

yet they continued to try and bill me for when I was not using their ISP or bundled TV service. They refused to allow XXXX to port my new number and held up the process. They exhibited extremely poor service and failed to follow through with promises on a regular basis. Now these scam artists are calling all hours of the day and while my elementary school aged son is asleep in bed for school. The other collections via XXXX have been removed from my report	1

yet when I request documents they blatantly refuse to provide me with anything. I no longer feel comfortable sending payments that they can not provide an accounting for. I have contacted the NJCLASS and they have n't been able to provide any assistance regarding this issue. During the initial period of which they claimed to have mail bills and contact me regarding a potential default I lived a multiple addresses while trying to find permanent housing. It 's highly probable that if they did send me notifications I did not recieve them because I was without a permanent address for several months.
